A PATTERN LANGUAGE
Volume 1, The Timeless Way of Building, and Volume
2, 4 Patrern Language, are two halves of a single work.
This book provides a language, for building and plan-
ning; the other book provides the theory and instruc-
tions for the use of the language. This book. describes the
detailed patterns for towns and neighborhoods, houses,
gardens, and rooms. The other book explains the disci-
pline which makes it possible to use these patterns to
create a building or a town. This book is the sourcebook of
the timeless way; the other is its practice and its origin.
The two books have evolved very much in parallel.
They have been growing over the last eight years, as
we have worked on the one hand to understand the
nature of the building process, and on the other hand to
construct an actual, possible pattern language. We have
been forced by practical considerations, to publish these
two books under separate covers; but in fact, they form
an indivisible whole. It is possible to read them sepa-
rately. But to gain the insight which we have tried to
communicate in them, it is essential that you read them
both.
The Timeless Way of Building describes the funda-
mental nature of the task of making towns and buildings.
A PATTERN LANGUAGE
It is shown there, that towns and buildings will not be
able to become alive, unless they are made by all the
people in society, and unless these people share a com-
mon pattern language, within which to make these
buildings, and unless this cornmon pattern language is
alive itself.
Tn this book, we present one possible pattern language,
of the kind called for in The Timeless Way. This lan-
guage is extremely practical. It is a language that we
have distilled from our own building and planning ef-
forts over the last eight years. You can use it to work
with your neighbors, to improve your town and neighbor-
hood. You can use it to design a house for yourself,
with your family; or to work with other people to de-
sign an office or a workshop or a public building like a
school. And you can use it to guide you in the actual
process of construction.
The elements of this language are entities called pat-
terns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs
over and over again in our environment, and then
describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such
a way that you can use this solution a million times over,
without ever doing it the same way twice.
For convenience and clarity, each pattern has the same
format. First, there is a picture, which shows an arche-
typal example of that pattern. Second, after the picture,
each pattern has an introductory paragraph, which sets
the context for the pattern, by explaining how it helps
to complete certain larger patterns. Then there are three
diamonds to mark the beginning of the problem. After
the diamonds there is a headline, in bold type. This
A PATTERN LANGUAGE
headline gives the essence of the problem in one or two
sentences. After the headline comes the body of the
problem. This is the longest section. It describes the
empirical background of the pattern, the evidence for its
validity, the range of different ways the pattern can be
manifested in a building, and so on. Then, again in
bold type, like the headline, is the solution—the heart
of the pattern—which describes the field of physical and
social relationships which are required to solve the stated
problem, in the stated context. This solution is always
exactly what you need to do, to build the pattern. Then,
after the solution, there is a diagram, which shows the
solution in the form of a diagram, with labels to indicate
its main components.
After the diagram, another three diamonds, to show
that the main body of the pattern is finished. And finally,
after the diamonds there is a paragraph which ties the
pattern to all those smaller patterns in the language,
which are needed to complete this pattern, to embellish
it, to All it out.
There are two essential purposes behind this format.
First, to present each pattern connected to other patterns,
so that you grasp the collection of all 253 patterns as a
whole, as a language, within which you can create an in-
finite variety of combinations. Second, to present the
problem and solution of each pattern in such a way that
you can judge it for yourself, and modify it, without
losing the essence that is central to it.
Let us next understand the nature of the connection
between patterns.
XI
A PATTERN LANGUAGE
The patterns are ordered, beginning with the very
largest, for regions and towns, then working down
through neighborhoods, clusters of buildings, buildings,
rooms and alcoves, ending finally with details of con-
struction.
This order, which is presented as a straight linear
sequerice, is essential to the way the language works. It is
presented, and explained more fully, in the next section.
What is most important about this sequence, is that it is
based on the connections between the patterns. Each
pattern is connected to certain “larger” patterns which
come above it in the language; and to certain “smaller”
patterns which come below it in the language. The pat-
tern helps to complete those larger patterns which are
“above” it, and is itself completed by those smaller pat-
terns which are “below” it.
Thus, for example, you will find that the pattern ac-
CESSIBLE GREEN (60), is connected first to certain larger
patterns: SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY (13), IDENTIFIABLE
NEIGHBORHOOD (14), WORK COMMUNITY (41), and
quirr Backs (59). These appear on its first page. And it
is also connected to certain smaller patterns: PosiTIVE
OUTDOOR SPACE (107), TREE PLACES (171), and GARDEN
WALL (173). These appear on its last page.
What this means, is that IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBOR-
HOOD, SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, WORK COMMUNITY, and
QUIET BACKS are incomplete, unless they contain an ac-
CESSIBLE GREEN; and that an ACCESSIBLE GREEN is itself
incomplete, unless it contains POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,
TREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.
And what it means in practical terms is that, if you
x
A PATTERN LANGUAGE
want to lay out a green according to this pattern, you
must not only follow the instructions which describe the
pattern itself, but must also try to embed the green
Within an IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD or in some sUB-
CULTURE BOUNDARY, and in a way that helps to form
quizr Backs; and then you must work to complete the
green by building in some posiTIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,
TREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.
In short, no pattern is an isolated entity. Each pattern
can exist in the world, only to the extent that is sup-
ported by other patterns: the larger patterns in which it
is embedded, the patterns of the same size that surround
it, and the smaller patterns which are embedded in it.
This is a fundamental view of the world, It says that
when you build a thing you cannot merely build that
thing in isolation, but must also repair the world around
it, and within it, so that the larger world at that one
place becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the
thing which you make takes its place in the web of na-
ture, as you make it.
Now we explain the nature of the relation between
problems and solutions, within the individual patterns.
Each solution is stated in such a way that it gives the
essential field of relationships needed to solve the prob-
lem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you
can solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by
adapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions
at the place where you are making it.
For this reason, we have tried to write each solution
in a way which imposes nothing on you. It contains only
those essentials which cannot be avoided if you really
XU
A PATTERN LANGUAGE
want to solve the problem. In this sense, we have tried,
in each solution, to capture the invariant property com-
mon to all places which succeed in solving the problem.
But of course, we have not always succeeded. The
solutions we have given to these problems vary in signif-
cance, Some are more true, more profound, more cer-
tain, than others. To show this clearly we have marked
every pattern, in the text itself, with two asterisks, or one
asterisk, or no asterisks.
In the patterns marked with two asterisks, we believe
that we have succeeded in stating a true invariant: in
short, that the solution we have stated summarizes a
property common to all possible ways of solving the
stated problem. In these two-asterisk cases we believe,
in short, that it is not possible to solve the stated prob-
lem properly, without shaping the environment in one
way or another according to the pattern that we have
given—and that, in these cases, the pattern describes
a deep and inescapable property of a well-formed en-
vironment.
In the patterns marked with one asterisk, we believe
that we have made some progress towards identifying
such an invariant: but that with careful work it will
certainly be possible to improve on the solution, In
these cases, we believe it would be wise for you to treat
the pattern with a certain amount of disrespect—and
that you seek out variants of the solution which we have
given, since there are almost certainly possible ranges of
solutions which are not covered by what we have written.
Finally, in the patterns without an asterisk, we are
certain that we have mot succeeded in defining a true
x1V
A PATTERN LANGUAGE
invariant—that, on the contrary, there are certainly ways
of solving the problem different from the one which we
have given. In these cases we have still stated a solution,
in order to be concrete—to provide the reader with at
least one way of solving the problem-—but the task of
finding the true invariant, the true property which hes
at the heart of all possible solutions to this problem, re-
mains undone.
We hope, of course, that many of the people who
read, and use this language, will try to improve these
patterns—will put their energy to work, in this task of
finding more true, more profound invariants—and we
hope that gradually these more true patterns, which are
slowly discovered, as time goes on, will enter a common
language, which all of us can share.
You see then that the patterns are very much alive
and evolving. In fact, if you like, each pattern may be
looked upon as a hypothesis like one of the hypotheses of
science. In this sense, each pattern represents our current
best guess as to what arrangement of the physical envi-
ronment will work to solve the problem presented. The
empirical questions center on the problem—does it occur
and is it felt in the way we have described it?—-and the
solution—-does the arrangement we propose in fact re-
solve the problem? And the asterisks represent our
degree of faith in these hypotheses. But of course, no
matter what the asterisks say, the patterns are still
hypotheses, all 253 of them-—-and are therefore all
tentative, all free to evolve under the impact of new
experience and observation.
Let us finally explain the status of this language, why
A PATTERN LANGUAGE
we have called it “A Pattern Language” with the em-
phasis on the word “A,” and how we imagine this pat-
tern language might be related to the countless thou-
sands of other languages we hope that people will make
for themselves, in the future.
The Timeless Way of Building says that every society
which is alive and whole, will have its own unique and
distinct pattern language; and further, that every in-
dividual in such a society will have a unique language,
shared in part, but which as a totality is unique to the
raind of the person who has it. In this sense, in a healthy
society there will be as many pattern languages as there
are people—even though these languages are shared and
simular,
The question then arises: What exactly is the status
of this published language? In what frame of mind, and
with what intention, are we publishing this language
here? The fact that it is published as a book means that
many thousands of people can use it. Is it not true that
there is a danger that people might come to rely on this
one printed language, instead of developing their own
languages, in their own minds?
The fact is, that we have written this book as a first
step in the society-wide process by which people will
gradually become conscious of their own pattern lan-
guages, and work to improve them. We believe, and
have explained in The Timeless Way of Building, that
the languages which people have today are so brutal, and
so fragmented, that most people no longer have any
language to speak of at all—and what they do have is
not based on human, or natural considerations.
XVI
& PATTERN LANGUAGE
We have spent years trying to formulate this lan-
guage, in the hope that when a person uses tt, he will
be so impressed by its power, and so joyful in its use,
that he will understand again, what it means to have a
living language of this kind. [If we only succeed in that,
it is possible that each person may once again embark on
the construction and development of his own language—
perhaps taking the language printed in this book, as a
point of departure.
And yet, we do believe, of course, that this language
which is printed here is something more than a manual,
or a teacher, or a version of a possible pattern language.
Many of the patterns here are archetypal—so deep, so
deeply rooted in the nature of things, that it seems likely
that they will be a part of human nature, and human ac-
tion, as much in five hundred years, as they are today.
We doubt very much whether anyone could construct
a valid pattern language, in his own mind, which did
not include the pattern arcapes (119) for example, or
the pattern aLcoves (179).
In this sense, we have also tried to penetrate, as deep
as we are able, into the nature of things in the environ-
ment: and hope that a great part of this language, which
we print here, will be a core of any sensible human pat-
tern language, which any person constructs for himself,
in his own mind. In this sense, at least a part of the
language we have presented here, is the archetypal core
of all possible pattern languages, which can make people
feel alive and human.
XVII
SUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE
A pattern language has the structure of a network. This
is explained fully in The Timeless Way of Bualdimg.
However, when we use the network of a language, we
always use it as a sequence, going through the patterns,
moving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,
always from the ones which create structures, to the ones
which then embellish those structures, and then to those
which embellish the embellishments. . . .
Since the language is in truth a network, there is no
one sequence which perfectly captures it. But the se-
quence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the
full network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down,
dips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little
like a needle following a tapestry.
The sequence of patterns is both a summary of the
language, and at the same time, an index to the patterns.
If you read through the sentences which connect the
groups of patterns to one another, you will get an over-
view of the whole language. And once you get this over-
view, you will then be able to find the patterns which
are relevant to your own project.
And finally, as we shall explain in the next section,
this sequence of patterns is also the “base map,” from
KVL
SUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE
which you can make a language for your own project,
by choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,
and leaving them more or less in the order that you
find them printed here.
We begin with that part of the language which defines
a town or community. These patterns can never be “de-
signed” or “buil?” in one fell swoop—but patient piece-
meal growth, designed in such a way that every indi-
vidual act is always helping to create or generate these
larger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the
years, make a community that has these global patterns
in tk.

This completes the global patterns which define a
town or 4 community, We now start that part of the
language which gives shape to groups of buildings, and
individual buildings, on the land, in three dimensions.
These ave the patterns which can be “designed” or
“built” —the patterns which define the individual build-
ings and the space between buildings; where we are deal-
ing for the first time with pauerns that are under the
control of individuals or small groups of individuals,
who are able to build the patterns all at once.
The first group of patterns helps to lay out the overall
arrangement of a group of buildings: the height and

parking areas, and lines of movement through the com-
plex;

given, you have a stheme of spaces, either marked on
the ground, with stakes, or on a piece of paper, accurate
to the nearest foot or so. You know the height of rooms,
the rough size and position of windows and doors, and
you know roughly how the roofs of the building, and

CHOOSING A LANGUAGE
FOR YOUR PROJECT
All 253 patterns together form a language. They create
a coherent picture of an entire region, with the power
to generate such regions in a million forms, with in-
finite variety in all the details.
It 1s also true that any small sequence of patterns from
this language is itself a language for a smaller part of
the environment; and this small list of patterns is then
capable of generating a million parks, paths, houses,
workshops, or gardens.
For example, consider the following ten patterns:
PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET (140)
SUNNY PLACE (161)
OUTDOOR ROOM (163)
SIX-FOOT BALCONY (167)
PATHS AND GOALS (120)
CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY (190)
COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS (212)
FRONT DOOR BENCH (242)
RAISED FLOWERS (245)
DIFFERENT CHAIRS (251)
This short list of patterns is itself a language: it is one
of a thousand possible languages for a porch, at the front
of a house, One of us chose this small language, to build

a porch onto the front of his house. This is the way the
language, and its patterns, helped to generate this porch.
I started with PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE sTREET (140). That
pattern calls for a terrace, slightly raised, connected to the house,
and on the street side. suNNY PLACE (161) suggests that a special
place on the sunny side of the yard should be intensified and
made into a place by the use of a patio, balcony, outdoor room,

it half under the existing roof overhang, and kept a mature
pyracanthus tree right smack in the middle of the platform. The
overhead foliage of the tree added to the roof-like enclosure of
the space. I put a wind screen of fixed glass on the west side of
the platform too, to give it even more enclosure.
platform. But this pattern had to be used judiciously and not
blindly—the reasoning for the pattern has to do with the mini-
mum space required for people to sit comfortably and carry on a
discussion around a small side-table. Since 1 wanted space for at
least two of these conversation areas—one under the roof for very
feet square.
Now PATHS AND Goats (120): Usually, this pattern deals with
large paths in a neighborhood, and comes much earlier in a lan-
guage. But I used it in a special way. It says that the paths which
naturally get formed by people’s walking, on the land, should be
preserved and intensified. Since the path to our front door cut
right across the corner of the place where 1 had planned to put
the platform, 1 cut the corner of the platform aff.
The height of the platform above the ground was determined
by CEILING HEIGHT varieETY (190). By building the platform
approximately one foot above the ground line, the ceiling height
of the covered portion came out at between 6 and 7 feet——just
right for a space as small as this. Since this height above the

the roof up. But, following covumns ar THE coRNERs (212),
the platform was very carefully tailored to their positions—so that
the columns help define the social spaces on either side of them.
Finally, we put a couple of flower boxes next to the “front door
bench”—it’s nice to smell them when you sit there—according to
RAISED FLowERs (245). And the old chairs you can see in the
porch are DIeFERENT CHAIRS (251).
You can see, from this short example, how powerful
and simple a pattern language is, And you are now,
perhaps ready to appreciate how careful you must be,
when you construct a language for yourself and your
own project.
The character of the porch is given by the ten patterns
in this short language. In just this way, each part of the
environment is given its character by the collection of
patterns which we choose to build into it. The character
of what you build, will be given to it by the language of
patterns you use, to generate it.
Xxxvii
CHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT
For this reason, of course, the task of choosing a lan-
guage for your project is fundamental. The pattern lan-
guage we have given here contains 253 patterns. You
can therefore use it to generate an almost unimaginably
large number of possible different smaller languages,
for all the different projects you may choose to do,
simply by picking patterns from it.
We shall now describe a rough procedure by which
you can choose a language for your own project, first by
taking patterns from this language we have printed here,
and then by adding patterns of your own.
r. First of all, make a copy of the master sequence
(pages xix-xxxiv) on which you can tick off the patterns
which will form the language for your project. If you
don’t have access to a copying machine, you can tick off
patterns in the list printed in the book, use paper clips
to mark pages, write your own list, use paper markers—
whatever you like. But just for now, to explain it clearly,
we shall assume that you have a copy of the list in front
of you.
2. Scan down the list, and find the pattern which
best describes the overall scope of the project you have
in mind, This is the starting pattern for your project.
Tick it. CIE there are two or three possible candidates,
don’t worry: just pick the one which seems best: the
others will fall in place as you move forward.)
3. Turn to the starting pattern itself, in the book, and
read it through. Notice that the other patterns men-
tioned by name at the beginning and at the end, of the
pattern you are reading, are also possible candidates for
your language. The ones at the beginning will tend to be
“larger” than your project. Don’t include them, unless
XXXVI
CHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT
you have the power to help create these patterns, at least
in a small way, in the world around your project. The
ones at the end are “smaller.” Almost all of them will
be important. Tick all of them, on your list, unless you
have some special reason for not wanting to include
them.
4. Now your list has some more ticks on it. Turn to
the next highest pattern on the list which is ticked, and
open the book to that pattern. Once again, it will lead
you to other patterns. Once again, tick those which are
relevant—especially the ones which are “smaller” that
come at the end. As a general rule, do not tick the ones
which are “larger” unless you can do something about
them, concretely, in your own project.
5. When in doubt about a pattern, don’t include it.
Your list can easily get too long: and if it does, it will
become confusing. The list will be quite long enough,
even if you only include the patterns you especially like.
6. Keep going like this, until you have ticked all the
patterns you want for your project.
7. Now, adjust the sequence by adding your own ma-
terial. If there are things you want to include in your
project, but you have not been able to find patterns which
correspond to them, then write them in, at an appropri-
ate point in the sequence, near other patterns which are
of about the same size and importance. For example,
there is no pattern for a sauna. If you want to include
one, write it in somewhere near BATHING ROOM (144)
in your sequence.
8. And of course, if you want to change any patterns,
change them. There are often cases where you may have
a personal version of a pattern, which is more true, or
XXXIN
CHOCSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT
more relevant for you. In this case, you will get the most
“power” over the language, and make it your own most
effectively, if you write the changes in, at the appropri-
ate places in the book. And, it will be most concrete of
all, if you change the name of the pattern too—so that
it captures your own changes clearly.

Suppose now that you have a language for your proj-
ect. The way to use the language depends very much
on its scale. Patterns dealing with towns can only be
implemented gradually, by grass roots action; patterns
for a building can be built up in your mind, and marked
out on the ground; patterns for construction must be
built physically, on the site. For this reason we have
given three separate instructions, for these three different
scales. For towns, see page 3; for buildings, see page
463; for construction, see page 935.
The procedures for each of these three scales are de-
scribed in much more detail with extensive examples,
in the appropriate chapters of The Timeless Way of
Building. For the town—see chapters 24 and 25; for an
individual building—see chapters 20, 21, and 22; and for
the process of construction which describes the way a
building is actually built see chapter 23.

THE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE
Finally, a note of caution. This language, lke English,
can be a medium for prose, or a medium for poetry. The
difference between prose and poetry is not that different
Janpuages are used, but that the same language is used,
differently. In an ordinary English sentence, each word
has one meaning, and the sentence too, has one simple
meaning. In a poem, the meaning is far more dense.
Each word carries several meanings; and the sentence
as a Whole carries an enormous density of interlocking
meanings, which together illuminate the whole.
The same is true for pattern languages. It is possible
to make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a
rather loose way. A building made like this, is an as-
sembly of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound.
But it 1s also possible to put patterns together in such a
way that many many patterns overlap in the same
physical space: the building is very dense; it has many
meanings captured in a small space; and through this
density, it becomes profound.
In a poern, this kind of density, creates illumination,
by making identities between words, and meanings,
whose identity we have not understood before. In “O
Rose thou art sick,” the rose is identifed with many
xii
THE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE
greater, and more personal things than any rose—and
the poem illuminates the person, and the rose, because of
this connection. The connection not only illuminates the
words, but also illuminates our actual lives.

That flies in the night
in the howling storm:

Does thy life destroy,
WILLIAM BLAKE
The same exactly, happens in a building, Consider, for
example, the two patterns BATHING ROOM (144) and
STILL WATER (71). One defines a part of a house where
you can bathe yourself slowly, with pleasure, perhaps
in company; a place to rest your limbs, and to relax. The
other is a place in a neighborhood, where this is water
to gaze into, perhaps to swim in, where children can sail
boats, and splash about, which nourishes those parts of
ourselves which rely on water as one of the great
elements of the unconscious.
Suppose now, that we make a complex of buildings
where individual bathing rooms are somehow connected
to a common pond, or lake, or pool—where the bathing
room merges with this common place; where there is no
sharp distinction between the individual and family pro-
cesses of the bathing room, and the common pleasure
of the common pool. In this place, these two patterns
THE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE
exist in the same space; they are identified, there is a
compression of the two, which requires less space, and
which is more profound than in a place where they are
merely side by side. The compression illuminates each
of the patterns, sheds light on its meaning; and also i-
luminates our lives, as we understand a little more about
the connections of our inner needs.
But this kind of compression is not only poetic and
profound. It is not only the stuff of poems and exotic
statements, but to some degree, the stuff of every English
sentence. To some depree, there is compression in every
single word we utter, just because each word carries the
whisper of the meanings of the words it is connected to.
Even “Please pass the butter, Fred” has some compres-
sion in it, because it carries overtones that lie in the con-
nections of these words to all the words which came be-
fore it.
Fach of us, talking to our friends, or to our families,
makes use of these compressions, which are drawn out
from the connections between words which are given by
the language. The more we can feel all the connections
in the language, the more rich and subtle are the things
we say at the most ordinary times.
And once again, the same is true in building. The com-
pression of patterns into a single space, is not a poetic
and exotic thing, kept for special buildings which are
works of art. It is the most ordinary economy of space. It
is quite possible that all the patterns for a house might,
in some form be present, and overlapping, in a simple
one-room cabin, The patterns do not need to be strung
out, and kept separate. Every building, every room,
xd
THE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE
every garden is better, when all the patterns which it
needs are compressed as far as it is possible for them to
be. The building will be cheaper; and the meanings in it
will be denser.
It is essential then, once you have learned to use the
language, that you pay attention to the possibility of
compressing the many patterns which you put together,
in the smallest possible space. You may think of this
process of compressing patterns, as a way to make the
cheapest possible building which has the necessary pat-
terns in it. It is, also, the only way of using a pattern
language to make buildings which are poems.
