[{"document":"A PATTERN LANGUAGE\nVolume 1, The Timeless Way of Building, and Volume\n2, 4 Patrern Language, are two halves of a single work.\nThis book provides a language, for building and plan-\nning; the other book provides the theory and instruc-\ntions for the use of the language. This book. describes the\ndetailed patterns for towns and neighborhoods, houses,\ngardens, and rooms. The other book explains the disci-\npline which makes it possible to use these patterns to\ncreate a building or a town. This book is the sourcebook of\nthe timeless way; the other is its practice and its origin.\nThe two books have evolved very much in parallel.\nThey have been growing over the last eight years, as\nwe have worked on the one hand to understand the\nnature of the building process, and on the other hand to\nconstruct an actual, possible pattern language. We have\nbeen forced by practical considerations, to publish these\ntwo books under separate covers; but in fact, they form\nan indivisible whole. It is possible to read them sepa-\nrately. But to gain the insight which we have tried to\ncommunicate in them, it is essential that you read them\nboth.\nThe Timeless Way of Building describes the funda-\nmental nature of the task of making towns and buildings.\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nIt is shown there, that towns and buildings will not be\nable to become alive, unless they are made by all the\npeople in society, and unless these people share a com-\nmon pattern language, within which to make these\nbuildings, and unless this cornmon pattern language is\nalive itself.\nTn this book, we present one possible pattern language,\nof the kind called for in The Timeless Way. This lan-\nguage is extremely practical. It is a language that we\nhave distilled from our own building and planning ef-\nforts over the last eight years. You can use it to work\nwith your neighbors, to improve your town and neighbor-\nhood. You can use it to design a house for yourself,\nwith your family; or to work with other people to de-\nsign an office or a workshop or a public building like a\nschool. And you can use it to guide you in the actual\nprocess of construction.\nThe elements of this language are entities called pat-\nterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs\nover and over again in our environment, and then\ndescribes the core of the solution to that problem, in such\na way that you can use this solution a million times over,\nwithout ever doing it the same way twice.\nFor convenience and clarity, each pattern has the same\nformat. First, there is a picture, which shows an arche-\ntypal example of that pattern. Second, after the picture,\neach pattern has an introductory paragraph, which sets\nthe context for the pattern, by explaining how it helps\nto complete certain larger patterns. Then there are three\ndiamonds to mark the beginning of the problem. After\nthe diamonds there is a headline, in bold type. This\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nheadline gives the essence of the problem in one or two\nsentences. After the headline comes the body of the\nproblem. This is the longest section. It describes the\nempirical background of the pattern, the evidence for its\nvalidity, the range of different ways the pattern can be\nmanifested in a building, and so on. Then, again in\nbold type, like the headline, is the solution—the heart\nof the pattern—which describes the field of physical and\nsocial relationships which are required to solve the stated\nproblem, in the stated context. This solution is always\nexactly what you need to do, to build the pattern. Then,\nafter the solution, there is a diagram, which shows the\nsolution in the form of a diagram, with labels to indicate\nits main components.\nAfter the diagram, another three diamonds, to show\nthat the main body of the pattern is finished. And finally,\nafter the diamonds there is a paragraph which ties the\npattern to all those smaller patterns in the language,\nwhich are needed to complete this pattern, to embellish\nit, to All it out.\nThere are two essential purposes behind this format.\nFirst, to present each pattern connected to other patterns,\nso that you grasp the collection of all 253 patterns as a\nwhole, as a language, within which you can create an in-\nfinite variety of combinations. Second, to present the\nproblem and solution of each pattern in such a way that\nyou can judge it for yourself, and modify it, without\nlosing the essence that is central to it.\nLet us next understand the nature of the connection\nbetween patterns.\nXI\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nThe patterns are ordered, beginning with the very\nlargest, for regions and towns, then working down\nthrough neighborhoods, clusters of buildings, buildings,\nrooms and alcoves, ending finally with details of con-\nstruction.\nThis order, which is presented as a straight linear\nsequerice, is essential to the way the language works. It is\npresented, and explained more fully, in the next section.\nWhat is most important about this sequence, is that it is\nbased on the connections between the patterns. Each\npattern is connected to certain “larger” patterns which\ncome above it in the language; and to certain “smaller”\npatterns which come below it in the language. The pat-\ntern helps to complete those larger patterns which are\n“above” it, and is itself completed by those smaller pat-\nterns which are “below” it.\nThus, for example, you will find that the pattern ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN (60), is connected first to certain larger\npatterns: SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY (13), IDENTIFIABLE\nNEIGHBORHOOD (14), WORK COMMUNITY (41), and\nquirr Backs (59). These appear on its first page. And it\nis also connected to certain smaller patterns: PosiTIVE\nOUTDOOR SPACE (107), TREE PLACES (171), and GARDEN\nWALL (173). These appear on its last page.\nWhat this means, is that IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBOR-\nHOOD, SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, WORK COMMUNITY, and\nQUIET BACKS are incomplete, unless they contain an ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN; and that an ACCESSIBLE GREEN is itself\nincomplete, unless it contains POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nAnd what it means in practical terms is that, if you\nx\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to lay out a green according to this pattern, you\nmust not only follow the instructions which describe the\npattern itself, but must also try to embed the green\nWithin an IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD or in some sUB-\nCULTURE BOUNDARY, and in a way that helps to form\nquizr Backs; and then you must work to complete the\ngreen by building in some posiTIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nIn short, no pattern is an isolated entity. Each pattern\ncan exist in the world, only to the extent that is sup-\nported by other patterns: the larger patterns in which it\nis embedded, the patterns of the same size that surround\nit, and the smaller patterns which are embedded in it.\nThis is a fundamental view of the world, It says that\nwhen you build a thing you cannot merely build that\nthing in isolation, but must also repair the world around\nit, and within it, so that the larger world at that one\nplace becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the\nthing which you make takes its place in the web of na-\nture, as you make it.\nNow we explain the nature of the relation between\nproblems and solutions, within the individual patterns.\nEach solution is stated in such a way that it gives the\nessential field of relationships needed to solve the prob-\nlem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you\ncan solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by\nadapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions\nat the place where you are making it.\nFor this reason, we have tried to write each solution\nin a way which imposes nothing on you. It contains only\nthose essentials which cannot be avoided if you really\nXU\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to solve the problem. In this sense, we have tried,\nin each solution, to capture the invariant property com-\nmon to all places which succeed in solving the problem.\nBut of course, we have not always succeeded. The\nsolutions we have given to these problems vary in signif-\ncance, Some are more true, more profound, more cer-\ntain, than others. To show this clearly we have marked\nevery pattern, in the text itself, with two asterisks, or one\nasterisk, or no asterisks.\nIn the patterns marked with two asterisks, we believe\nthat we have succeeded in stating a true invariant: in\nshort, that the solution we have stated summarizes a\nproperty common to all possible ways of solving the\nstated problem. In these two-asterisk cases we believe,\nin short, that it is not possible to solve the stated prob-\nlem properly, without shaping the environment in one\nway or another according to the pattern that we have\ngiven—and that, in these cases, the pattern describes\na deep and inescapable property of a well-formed en-\nvironment.\nIn the patterns marked with one asterisk, we believe\nthat we have made some progress towards identifying\nsuch an invariant: but that with careful work it will\ncertainly be possible to improve on the solution, In\nthese cases, we believe it would be wise for you to treat\nthe pattern with a certain amount of disrespect—and\nthat you seek out variants of the solution which we have\ngiven, since there are almost certainly possible ranges of\nsolutions which are not covered by what we have written.\nFinally, in the patterns without an asterisk, we are\ncertain that we have mot succeeded in defining a true\nx1V\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\ninvariant—that, on the contrary, there are certainly ways\nof solving the problem different from the one which we\nhave given. In these cases we have still stated a solution,\nin order to be concrete—to provide the reader with at\nleast one way of solving the problem-—but the task of\nfinding the true invariant, the true property which hes\nat the heart of all possible solutions to this problem, re-\nmains undone.\nWe hope, of course, that many of the people who\nread, and use this language, will try to improve these\npatterns—will put their energy to work, in this task of\nfinding more true, more profound invariants—and we\nhope that gradually these more true patterns, which are\nslowly discovered, as time goes on, will enter a common\nlanguage, which all of us can share.\nYou see then that the patterns are very much alive\nand evolving. In fact, if you like, each pattern may be\nlooked upon as a hypothesis like one of the hypotheses of\nscience. In this sense, each pattern represents our current\nbest guess as to what arrangement of the physical envi-\nronment will work to solve the problem presented. The\nempirical questions center on the problem—does it occur\nand is it felt in the way we have described it?—-and the\nsolution—-does the arrangement we propose in fact re-\nsolve the problem? And the asterisks represent our\ndegree of faith in these hypotheses. But of course, no\nmatter what the asterisks say, the patterns are still\nhypotheses, all 253 of them-—-and are therefore all\ntentative, all free to evolve under the impact of new\nexperience and observation.\nLet us finally explain the status of this language, why\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwe have called it “A Pattern Language” with the em-\nphasis on the word “A,” and how we imagine this pat-\ntern language might be related to the countless thou-\nsands of other languages we hope that people will make\nfor themselves, in the future.\nThe Timeless Way of Building says that every society\nwhich is alive and whole, will have its own unique and\ndistinct pattern language; and further, that every in-\ndividual in such a society will have a unique language,\nshared in part, but which as a totality is unique to the\nraind of the person who has it. In this sense, in a healthy\nsociety there will be as many pattern languages as there\nare people—even though these languages are shared and\nsimular,\nThe question then arises: What exactly is the status\nof this published language? In what frame of mind, and\nwith what intention, are we publishing this language\nhere? The fact that it is published as a book means that\nmany thousands of people can use it. Is it not true that\nthere is a danger that people might come to rely on this\none printed language, instead of developing their own\nlanguages, in their own minds?\nThe fact is, that we have written this book as a first\nstep in the society-wide process by which people will\ngradually become conscious of their own pattern lan-\nguages, and work to improve them. We believe, and\nhave explained in The Timeless Way of Building, that\nthe languages which people have today are so brutal, and\nso fragmented, that most people no longer have any\nlanguage to speak of at all—and what they do have is\nnot based on human, or natural considerations.\nXVI\n& PATTERN LANGUAGE\nWe have spent years trying to formulate this lan-\nguage, in the hope that when a person uses tt, he will\nbe so impressed by its power, and so joyful in its use,\nthat he will understand again, what it means to have a\nliving language of this kind. [If we only succeed in that,\nit is possible that each person may once again embark on\nthe construction and development of his own language—\nperhaps taking the language printed in this book, as a\npoint of departure.\nAnd yet, we do believe, of course, that this language\nwhich is printed here is something more than a manual,\nor a teacher, or a version of a possible pattern language.\nMany of the patterns here are archetypal—so deep, so\ndeeply rooted in the nature of things, that it seems likely\nthat they will be a part of human nature, and human ac-\ntion, as much in five hundred years, as they are today.\nWe doubt very much whether anyone could construct\na valid pattern language, in his own mind, which did\nnot include the pattern arcapes (119) for example, or\nthe pattern aLcoves (179).\nIn this sense, we have also tried to penetrate, as deep\nas we are able, into the nature of things in the environ-\nment: and hope that a great part of this language, which\nwe print here, will be a core of any sensible human pat-\ntern language, which any person constructs for himself,\nin his own mind. In this sense, at least a part of the\nlanguage we have presented here, is the archetypal core\nof all possible pattern languages, which can make people\nfeel alive and human.\nXVII\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nA pattern language has the structure of a network. This\nis explained fully in The Timeless Way of Bualdimg.\nHowever, when we use the network of a language, we\nalways use it as a sequence, going through the patterns,\nmoving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,\nalways from the ones which create structures, to the ones\nwhich then embellish those structures, and then to those\nwhich embellish the embellishments. . . .\nSince the language is in truth a network, there is no\none sequence which perfectly captures it. But the se-\nquence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the\nfull network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down,\ndips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little\nlike a needle following a tapestry.\nThe sequence of patterns is both a summary of the\nlanguage, and at the same time, an index to the patterns.\nIf you read through the sentences which connect the\ngroups of patterns to one another, you will get an over-\nview of the whole language. And once you get this over-\nview, you will then be able to find the patterns which\nare relevant to your own project.\nAnd finally, as we shall explain in the next section,\nthis sequence of patterns is also the “base map,” from\nKVL\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nwhich you can make a language for your own project,\nby choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,\nand leaving them more or less in the order that you\nfind them printed here.\nWe begin with that part of the language which defines\na town or community. These patterns can never be “de-\nsigned” or “buil?” in one fell swoop—but patient piece-\nmeal growth, designed in such a way that every indi-\nvidual act is always helping to create or generate these\nlarger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the\nyears, make a community that has these global patterns\nin tk.\nI.

They create\na coherent picture of an entire region, with the power\nto generate such regions in a million forms, with in-\nfinite variety in all the details.\nIt 1s also true that any small sequence of patterns from\nthis language is itself a language for a smaller part of\nthe environment; and this small list of patterns is then\ncapable of generating a million parks, paths, houses,\nworkshops, or gardens.\nFor example, consider the following ten patterns:\nPRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET (140)\nSUNNY PLACE (161)\nOUTDOOR ROOM (163)\nSIX-FOOT BALCONY (167)\nPATHS AND GOALS (120)\nCEILING HEIGHT VARIETY (190)\nCOLUMNS AT THE CORNERS (212)\nFRONT DOOR BENCH (242)\nRAISED FLOWERS (245)\nDIFFERENT CHAIRS (251)\nThis short list of patterns is itself a language: it is one\nof a thousand possible languages for a porch, at the front\nof a house, One of us chose this small language, to build\nAXERV\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBYJECT\na porch onto the front of his house. This is the way the\nlanguage, and its patterns, helped to generate this porch.\nI started with PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE sTREET (140). That\npattern calls for a terrace, slightly raised, connected to the house,\nand on the street side. suNNY PLACE (161) suggests that a special\nplace on the sunny side of the yard should be intensified and\nmade into a place by the use of a patio, balcony, outdoor room,\netc, | used these two patterns to locate a raised platform on the\nsouth side of the house.\nit half under the existing roof overhang, and kept a mature\npyracanthus tree right smack in the middle of the platform. The\noverhead foliage of the tree added to the roof-like enclosure of\nthe space. I put a wind screen of fixed glass on the west side of\nthe platform too, to give it even more enclosure.\nplatform. But this pattern had to be used judiciously and not\nblindly—the reasoning for the pattern has to do with the mini-\nmum space required for people to sit comfortably and carry on a\ndiscussion around a small side-table. Since 1 wanted space for at\nleast two of these conversation areas—one under the roof for very\nfeet square.\nNow PATHS AND Goats (120): Usually, this pattern deals with\nlarge paths in a neighborhood, and comes much earlier in a lan-\nguage. But I used it in a special way. It says that the paths which\nnaturally get formed by people’s walking, on the land, should be\npreserved and intensified. Since the path to our front door cut\nright across the corner of the place where 1 had planned to put\nthe platform, 1 cut the corner of the platform aff.\nThe height of the platform above the ground was determined\nby CEILING HEIGHT varieETY (190). By building the platform\napproximately one foot above the ground line, the ceiling height\nof the covered portion came out at between 6 and 7 feet——just\nright for a space as small as this. Since this height above the\nBOOR BENCH (242) was automatically satisfied.\nThere were three columns standing, supporting the roof over\nXXXVI]ground level is just about right for sitting, the pattern FRONT\nhot or rainy days, and one out under the sky for days when you\nwanted to be full in the sun, the balcony had to be made 12 x 12\nI used six-Foor BaLcony (167) to determine the size of the\nTo make this platform into an ovTsoor Room (163), I put\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nthe old porch, They had to stay where they are, because they hold\nthe roof up. But, following covumns ar THE coRNERs (212),\nthe platform was very carefully tailored to their positions—so that\nthe columns help define the social spaces on either side of them.\nFinally, we put a couple of flower boxes next to the “front door\nbench”—it’s nice to smell them when you sit there—according to\nRAISED FLowERs (245). And the old chairs you can see in the\nporch are DIeFERENT CHAIRS (251).\nYou can see, from this short example, how powerful\nand simple a pattern language is, And you are now,\nperhaps ready to appreciate how careful you must be,\nwhen you construct a language for yourself and your\nown project.\nThe character of the porch is given by the ten patterns\nin this short language. In just this way, each part of the\nenvironment is given its character by the collection of\npatterns which we choose to build into it. The character\nof what you build, will be given to it by the language of\npatterns you use, to generate it.\nXxxvii\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nFor this reason, of course, the task of choosing a lan-\nguage for your project is fundamental. The pattern lan-\nguage we have given here contains 253 patterns. You\ncan therefore use it to generate an almost unimaginably\nlarge number of possible different smaller languages,\nfor all the different projects you may choose to do,\nsimply by picking patterns from it.\nWe shall now describe a rough procedure by which\nyou can choose a language for your own project, first by\ntaking patterns from this language we have printed here,\nand then by adding patterns of your own.\nr. First of all, make a copy of the master sequence\n(pages xix-xxxiv) on which you can tick off the patterns\nwhich will form the language for your project. If you\ndon’t have access to a copying machine, you can tick off\npatterns in the list printed in the book, use paper clips\nto mark pages, write your own list, use paper markers—\nwhatever you like. But just for now, to explain it clearly,\nwe shall assume that you have a copy of the list in front\nof you.\n2. Scan down the list, and find the pattern which\nbest describes the overall scope of the project you have\nin mind, This is the starting pattern for your project.\nTick it. CIE there are two or three possible candidates,\ndon’t worry: just pick the one which seems best: the\nothers will fall in place as you move forward.)\n3. Turn to the starting pattern itself, in the book, and\nread it through. Notice that the other patterns men-\ntioned by name at the beginning and at the end, of the\npattern you are reading, are also possible candidates for\nyour language. The ones at the beginning will tend to be\n“larger” than your project. Don’t include them, unless\nXXXVI\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nyou have the power to help create these patterns, at least\nin a small way, in the world around your project. The\nones at the end are “smaller.” Almost all of them will\nbe important. Tick all of them, on your list, unless you\nhave some special reason for not wanting to include\nthem.\n4. Now your list has some more ticks on it. Turn to\nthe next highest pattern on the list which is ticked, and\nopen the book to that pattern. Once again, it will lead\nyou to other patterns. Once again, tick those which are\nrelevant—especially the ones which are “smaller” that\ncome at the end. As a general rule, do not tick the ones\nwhich are “larger” unless you can do something about\nthem, concretely, in your own project.\n5. When in doubt about a pattern, don’t include it.\nYour list can easily get too long: and if it does, it will\nbecome confusing. The list will be quite long enough,\neven if you only include the patterns you especially like.\n6. Keep going like this, until you have ticked all the\npatterns you want for your project.\n7. Now, adjust the sequence by adding your own ma-\nterial. If there are things you want to include in your\nproject, but you have not been able to find patterns which\ncorrespond to them, then write them in, at an appropri-\nate point in the sequence, near other patterns which are\nof about the same size and importance. For example,\nthere is no pattern for a sauna. If you want to include\none, write it in somewhere near BATHING ROOM (144)\nin your sequence.\n8. And of course, if you want to change any patterns,\nchange them. There are often cases where you may have\na personal version of a pattern, which is more true, or\nXXXIN\nCHOCSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nmore relevant for you. In this case, you will get the most\n“power” over the language, and make it your own most\neffectively, if you write the changes in, at the appropri-\nate places in the book. And, it will be most concrete of\nall, if you change the name of the pattern too—so that\nit captures your own changes clearly.\nyp oe\nSuppose now that you have a language for your proj-\nect. The way to use the language depends very much\non its scale. Patterns dealing with towns can only be\nimplemented gradually, by grass roots action; patterns\nfor a building can be built up in your mind, and marked\nout on the ground; patterns for construction must be\nbuilt physically, on the site. For this reason we have\ngiven three separate instructions, for these three different\nscales. For towns, see page 3; for buildings, see page\n463; for construction, see page 935.\nThe procedures for each of these three scales are de-\nscribed in much more detail with extensive examples,\nin the appropriate chapters of The Timeless Way of\nBuilding. For the town—see chapters 24 and 25; for an\nindividual building—see chapters 20, 21, and 22; and for\nthe process of construction which describes the way a\nbuilding is actually built see chapter 23.\nxh\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nFinally, a note of caution. This language, lke English,\ncan be a medium for prose, or a medium for poetry. The\ndifference between prose and poetry is not that different\nJanpuages are used, but that the same language is used,\ndifferently. In an ordinary English sentence, each word\nhas one meaning, and the sentence too, has one simple\nmeaning. In a poem, the meaning is far more dense.\nEach word carries several meanings; and the sentence\nas a Whole carries an enormous density of interlocking\nmeanings, which together illuminate the whole.\nThe same is true for pattern languages. It is possible\nto make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a\nrather loose way. A building made like this, is an as-\nsembly of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound.\nBut it 1s also possible to put patterns together in such a\nway that many many patterns overlap in the same\nphysical space: the building is very dense; it has many\nmeanings captured in a small space; and through this\ndensity, it becomes profound.\nIn a poern, this kind of density, creates illumination,\nby making identities between words, and meanings,\nwhose identity we have not understood before. In “O\nRose thou art sick,” the rose is identifed with many\nxii\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\ngreater, and more personal things than any rose—and\nthe poem illuminates the person, and the rose, because of\nthis connection. The connection not only illuminates the\nwords, but also illuminates our actual lives.\n© Rose thon art sick,\n‘The invisible worm,\nThat flies in the night\nin the howling storm:\nHas found out thy bed\nOF crimson joy:\nAnd his dark secret Jove\nDoes thy life destroy,\nWILLIAM BLAKE\nThe same exactly, happens in a building, Consider, for\nexample, the two patterns BATHING ROOM (144) and\nSTILL WATER (71). One defines a part of a house where\nyou can bathe yourself slowly, with pleasure, perhaps\nin company; a place to rest your limbs, and to relax. The\nother is a place in a neighborhood, where this is water\nto gaze into, perhaps to swim in, where children can sail\nboats, and splash about, which nourishes those parts of\nourselves which rely on water as one of the great\nelements of the unconscious.\nSuppose now, that we make a complex of buildings\nwhere individual bathing rooms are somehow connected\nto a common pond, or lake, or pool—where the bathing\nroom merges with this common place; where there is no\nsharp distinction between the individual and family pro-\ncesses of the bathing room, and the common pleasure\nof the common pool. In this place, these two patterns\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nexist in the same space; they are identified, there is a\ncompression of the two, which requires less space, and\nwhich is more profound than in a place where they are\nmerely side by side. The compression illuminates each\nof the patterns, sheds light on its meaning; and also i-\nluminates our lives, as we understand a little more about\nthe connections of our inner needs.\nBut this kind of compression is not only poetic and\nprofound. It is not only the stuff of poems and exotic\nstatements, but to some degree, the stuff of every English\nsentence. To some depree, there is compression in every\nsingle word we utter, just because each word carries the\nwhisper of the meanings of the words it is connected to.\nEven “Please pass the butter, Fred” has some compres-\nsion in it, because it carries overtones that lie in the con-\nnections of these words to all the words which came be-\nfore it.\nFach of us, talking to our friends, or to our families,\nmakes use of these compressions, which are drawn out\nfrom the connections between words which are given by\nthe language. The more we can feel all the connections\nin the language, the more rich and subtle are the things\nwe say at the most ordinary times.\nAnd once again, the same is true in building. The com-\npression of patterns into a single space, is not a poetic\nand exotic thing, kept for special buildings which are\nworks of art. It is the most ordinary economy of space. It\nis quite possible that all the patterns for a house might,\nin some form be present, and overlapping, in a simple\none-room cabin, The patterns do not need to be strung\nout, and kept separate. Every building, every room,\nxd\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nevery garden is better, when all the patterns which it\nneeds are compressed as far as it is possible for them to\nbe. The building will be cheaper; and the meanings in it\nwill be denser.\nIt is essential then, once you have learned to use the\nlanguage, that you pay attention to the possibility of\ncompressing the many patterns which you put together,\nin the smallest possible space. You may think of this\nprocess of compressing patterns, as a way to make the\ncheapest possible building which has the necessary pat-\nterns in it. It is, also, the only way of using a pattern\nlanguage to make buildings which are poems.\n","summary":"This chunk discusses the \"Four-Story Limit\" pattern, which is part of a larger pattern language for designing towns, neighborhoods, buildings, and rooms. It provides evidence and rationale for limiting building heights to four stories or less in urban areas, and explains how this pattern relates to and interacts with other patterns in the language.","chunk":"# 21 Four-Story Limit**\n\n![57_Image_0.Png](57_Image_0.Png)\n\n. . . within an urban area, the density of building fluctuates. It will, in general, be rather higher toward the center and lower toward the edges-ciry country FINCERS (3), LACE of COUN-\nTRY STREETS (5), MAGIC OF THE CITY (10). However, throughout the city, even at its densest points, there are strong human reasons to subject all buildings to height restrictions.\n\nThere is abundant evidence to show that high buildings make people crazy.\n\nHigh buildings have no genuine advantages, except in speculative gains for banks and land owners. They are not cheaper, they do not help create open space, they destroy the townscape, they destroy social life, they promote crime, they make life difficult for children, they are expensive to maintain, they wreck the open spaces near them, and they damage light and air and view.\n\nBut quite apart from all of this, which shows that they aren't very sensible, empirical evidence shows that they can actually damage people's minds and feelings.\n\n![58_image_0.png](58_image_0.png)\n\n\"The Ministry of Truth-Minitrue, in Newspeak-was startlingly different from any other object in sight.\n\nIt was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering evhite concrete, soaring up terrace after terrace 300 metres in the air.\" (George Orevell, 1984)\nThere are two separate bodies of evidence for this. One shows the effect of high-rise housing on the mental and social well being of families. The other shows the effect of large buildings, and high buildings, on the human relations in offices and workplaces. We present the first of these two bodies of evidence in the text which follows. The second, concerning offices and workplaces, we have placed in BUILDING COMPLEX (95), since it has implications not just for the height of buildings but also for their total volume.\n\nWe wish to stress, however, that the seemingly one-sided concern with housing in the paragraphs which follow, is only apparent. The underlying phenomenon -- namely, mental disorder and social alienation created by the height of buildings-occurs equally in housing and in workplaces.\n\nThe strongest evidence comes from D. M. Fanning (\"Families in Flats,\" British Medical Journal, November 18, 1967, pp. 38286). Fanning shows a direct correlation between incidence of mental disorder and the height of people's apartments. The higher people live off the ground, the more likely are they to suffer mental illness. And it is not simply a case of people prone to mental illness choosing high-rise apartments. Fanning shows that the correlation is strongest for the people who spend the most time in their apartments. Among the families he studied, the correlation was strongest for women, who spend the most time in their apartments; it was less strong for children, who spend less time in the apartments; and it was weakest for men, who spend the least amount of time in their apartments. This strongly suggests that sheer time spent in the high-rise is itself what causes the effect.\n\nA simple mechanism may explain this: high-rise living takes people away from the ground, and away from the casual, everyday society that occurs on the sidewalks and streets and on the gardens and porches. It leaves them alone in their apartments. The decision to go out for some public life becomes formal and awkward; and unless there is some specific task which brings people out in the world, the tendency is to stay home, alone. The forced isolation then causes individual breakdowns.\n\nFanning's findings are reinforced by Dr. D. Cappon's clinical experiences reported in \"Mental Health and the High Rise,\"\nCanadian Public Health Association, April 1971:\n\n## Ii6\n\nThere is every reason to believe that high-rise apartment dwelling has adverse effects on mental and social health. And there is sufficient clinical, anecdotal and intuitive observations to back this up. Herewith, in no particular order ranking, a host of factors:\nIn my experience as Mental Health Director in a child guidance clinic in York Township, Toronto, for 5 years, I saw numerous children who had been kinetically deprived . . . and kinetic deprivation is the worst of the perceptual, exploratory kinds, for a young child, leaving legacies of lethargy, or restlessness, antisocial acting out or withdrawal, depersonalization or psychopathy.\n\nYoung children in a high-rise are much more socially deprived of neighborhood peers and activities than their S.F.D. (Single Family Dwelling) counterparts, hence they are poorly socialized and at too close quarters to adults, who are tense and irritable as a consequence.\n\nAdolescents in a high-rise suffer more from the \"nothing-to-do\" ennui than those of a S.F.D., with enhanced social needs for \"drop in centres\" and a greater tendency to escapism. . . .\n\nMothers are more anxious about their very young ones, when they can't see them in the street below, from a convenient kitchen window.\n\nThere is higher passivity in the high-rise because of the barriers to active outlets on the ground; such barriers as elevators, corridors; and generally there is a time lapse and an effort in negotiating the vertical journey. TV watching is extended in the high-rise. This affects probably most adversely the old who need kinesia and activity, in proportion, as much as the very young do. Though immobility saves them from accidents, it also shortens their life in a high-rise. . . .\n\nA Danish study by Jeanne Morville adds more evidence (Borns Brug af Friarsaler, Disponering Af Friarsaler, Etageboligomrader Med Saerlig Henblik Pa Borns Legsmuligheder, S.B.I., Denmark, 1969) :\nChildren from the high blocks start playing out of doors on their own at a later age than children from the low blocks: Only 2% of the children aged two to three years in the high point blocks play on their own out of doors, while 27% of the children in the low blocks do this.\n\nAmong the children aged five years in the high point blocks 29%\ndo not as yet play on their own out of doors, while in the low blocks all the children aged five do so. . . . The percentage of young children playing out of doors on their own decreases with the height of their homes; 90% of all the children from the three lower floors in the high point blocks play on their own out of doors, while only 59% of the children from the three upper floors do so. . . .\n\nYoung children in the high blocks have fewer contacts with playmates than those in the low blocks: Among children aged one, two and three years, 86% from the low blocks have daily contact with playmates; this applies to only 29% from the high blocks.\n\nMore recently, there is the evidence brought forward by Oscar Newman in Defensible Space. Newman compared two adjacent housing projects in New York-one high-rise, the other a collection of relatively small three-story walk-up buildings. The two projects have the same overall density, and their inhabitants have roughly the same income. But Newman found that the crime rate in the high-rise was roughly twice that in the walk-ups.\n\nAt what height do the effects described by Fanning, Cappon, Morville, and Newman begin to take hold? It is our experience that in both housing and office buildings, the problems begin when buildings are more than four stories high.\n\nAt three or four stories, one can still walk comfortably down to the street, and from a window you can still feel part of the street scene: you can see details in the street-the people, their faces, foliage, shops. From three stories you can yell out, and catch the attention of someone below. Above four stories these connections break down. The visual detail is lost; people speak of the scene below as if it were a game, from which they are completely detached. The connection to the ground and to the fabric of the town becomes tenuous; the building becomes a world of its own: with its own elevators and cafeterias.\n\nWe believe, therefore, that the \"four-story limit\" is an appropriate way to express the proper connection between building height and the health of a people. Of course, it is the spirit of the pattern which is most essential. Certainly, a building five stories high, perhaps even six, might work if it were carefully handled.\n\nBut it is difficult. On the whole, we advocate a four-story limit, with only occasional departures, throughout the town.\n\nFinally, we give the children of Glasgow the last word.\n\nTo fling a \"picce,\" a slice of bread and jam, from a window down to a child in the street below has been a recognised custom in Glasgow's tenement housing. . . .\n\nTHE JEELY PIECE SONG\nby Adam McNaughton I'm a skyscraper wean, I live on the nineteenth flair, On' I'm no' gaun oot tae play ony mair, For since we moved tae oor new hoose I'm wastin' away,\n'Cos I'm gettin' wan less meal ev'ry day,\n\nRefrain Oh, ye canny fling pieces oot a twenty-storey flat, Seven hundred hungry weans will testify tae that, If it's butter, cheese or jeely, if the breid is plain or pan, The odds against it reachin' us is ninety-nine tae wan.\n\nWe've wrote away tae Oxfam tae try an' get some aid, We've a' joined thegither an' formed a \"piece\" brigade, We're gonny march tae London tae demand oor Civil Rights, Like \"Nae mair hooses ower piece flingin' heights.\"\nTherefore:\nIn any urban area, no matter how dense, keep the majority of buildings four stories high or less. It is possible that certain buildings should exceed this limit, but they should never be buildings for human habitation.\n\n![62_image_0.png](62_image_0.png)\n\nWithin the framework of the four-story limit the exact height of individual buildings, according to the area of floor they need, the area of the site, and the height of surrounding buildings, is given by the pattern NUMBER OF STORIES (96). More global variations of density are given by DENSITY RINGS (29). The horizontal subdivision of large buildings into smaller units, and separate smaller buildings, is given by BUILDING COMPLEX (95). HOUSING HILL. (39) and OFFICE CONNECTIONS (82) help to shape multi-storied apartments and offices within the constraints of a four-story limit. And finally, don't take the four-story limit too literally. Occasional exceptions from the general rule are very important-HIGH PLACES (62). . . .\n","embeddings":[null]},{"document":"A PATTERN LANGUAGE\nVolume 1, The Timeless Way of Building, and Volume\n2, 4 Patrern Language, are two halves of a single work.\nThis book provides a language, for building and plan-\nning; the other book provides the theory and instruc-\ntions for the use of the language. This book. describes the\ndetailed patterns for towns and neighborhoods, houses,\ngardens, and rooms. The other book explains the disci-\npline which makes it possible to use these patterns to\ncreate a building or a town. This book is the sourcebook of\nthe timeless way; the other is its practice and its origin.\nThe two books have evolved very much in parallel.\nThey have been growing over the last eight years, as\nwe have worked on the one hand to understand the\nnature of the building process, and on the other hand to\nconstruct an actual, possible pattern language. We have\nbeen forced by practical considerations, to publish these\ntwo books under separate covers; but in fact, they form\nan indivisible whole. It is possible to read them sepa-\nrately. But to gain the insight which we have tried to\ncommunicate in them, it is essential that you read them\nboth.\nThe Timeless Way of Building describes the funda-\nmental nature of the task of making towns and buildings.\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nIt is shown there, that towns and buildings will not be\nable to become alive, unless they are made by all the\npeople in society, and unless these people share a com-\nmon pattern language, within which to make these\nbuildings, and unless this cornmon pattern language is\nalive itself.\nTn this book, we present one possible pattern language,\nof the kind called for in The Timeless Way. This lan-\nguage is extremely practical. It is a language that we\nhave distilled from our own building and planning ef-\nforts over the last eight years. You can use it to work\nwith your neighbors, to improve your town and neighbor-\nhood. You can use it to design a house for yourself,\nwith your family; or to work with other people to de-\nsign an office or a workshop or a public building like a\nschool. And you can use it to guide you in the actual\nprocess of construction.\nThe elements of this language are entities called pat-\nterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs\nover and over again in our environment, and then\ndescribes the core of the solution to that problem, in such\na way that you can use this solution a million times over,\nwithout ever doing it the same way twice.\nFor convenience and clarity, each pattern has the same\nformat. First, there is a picture, which shows an arche-\ntypal example of that pattern. Second, after the picture,\neach pattern has an introductory paragraph, which sets\nthe context for the pattern, by explaining how it helps\nto complete certain larger patterns. Then there are three\ndiamonds to mark the beginning of the problem. After\nthe diamonds there is a headline, in bold type. This\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nheadline gives the essence of the problem in one or two\nsentences. After the headline comes the body of the\nproblem. This is the longest section. It describes the\nempirical background of the pattern, the evidence for its\nvalidity, the range of different ways the pattern can be\nmanifested in a building, and so on. Then, again in\nbold type, like the headline, is the solution—the heart\nof the pattern—which describes the field of physical and\nsocial relationships which are required to solve the stated\nproblem, in the stated context. This solution is always\nexactly what you need to do, to build the pattern. Then,\nafter the solution, there is a diagram, which shows the\nsolution in the form of a diagram, with labels to indicate\nits main components.\nAfter the diagram, another three diamonds, to show\nthat the main body of the pattern is finished. And finally,\nafter the diamonds there is a paragraph which ties the\npattern to all those smaller patterns in the language,\nwhich are needed to complete this pattern, to embellish\nit, to All it out.\nThere are two essential purposes behind this format.\nFirst, to present each pattern connected to other patterns,\nso that you grasp the collection of all 253 patterns as a\nwhole, as a language, within which you can create an in-\nfinite variety of combinations. Second, to present the\nproblem and solution of each pattern in such a way that\nyou can judge it for yourself, and modify it, without\nlosing the essence that is central to it.\nLet us next understand the nature of the connection\nbetween patterns.\nXI\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nThe patterns are ordered, beginning with the very\nlargest, for regions and towns, then working down\nthrough neighborhoods, clusters of buildings, buildings,\nrooms and alcoves, ending finally with details of con-\nstruction.\nThis order, which is presented as a straight linear\nsequerice, is essential to the way the language works. It is\npresented, and explained more fully, in the next section.\nWhat is most important about this sequence, is that it is\nbased on the connections between the patterns. Each\npattern is connected to certain “larger” patterns which\ncome above it in the language; and to certain “smaller”\npatterns which come below it in the language. The pat-\ntern helps to complete those larger patterns which are\n“above” it, and is itself completed by those smaller pat-\nterns which are “below” it.\nThus, for example, you will find that the pattern ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN (60), is connected first to certain larger\npatterns: SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY (13), IDENTIFIABLE\nNEIGHBORHOOD (14), WORK COMMUNITY (41), and\nquirr Backs (59). These appear on its first page. And it\nis also connected to certain smaller patterns: PosiTIVE\nOUTDOOR SPACE (107), TREE PLACES (171), and GARDEN\nWALL (173). These appear on its last page.\nWhat this means, is that IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBOR-\nHOOD, SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, WORK COMMUNITY, and\nQUIET BACKS are incomplete, unless they contain an ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN; and that an ACCESSIBLE GREEN is itself\nincomplete, unless it contains POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nAnd what it means in practical terms is that, if you\nx\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to lay out a green according to this pattern, you\nmust not only follow the instructions which describe the\npattern itself, but must also try to embed the green\nWithin an IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD or in some sUB-\nCULTURE BOUNDARY, and in a way that helps to form\nquizr Backs; and then you must work to complete the\ngreen by building in some posiTIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nIn short, no pattern is an isolated entity. Each pattern\ncan exist in the world, only to the extent that is sup-\nported by other patterns: the larger patterns in which it\nis embedded, the patterns of the same size that surround\nit, and the smaller patterns which are embedded in it.\nThis is a fundamental view of the world, It says that\nwhen you build a thing you cannot merely build that\nthing in isolation, but must also repair the world around\nit, and within it, so that the larger world at that one\nplace becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the\nthing which you make takes its place in the web of na-\nture, as you make it.\nNow we explain the nature of the relation between\nproblems and solutions, within the individual patterns.\nEach solution is stated in such a way that it gives the\nessential field of relationships needed to solve the prob-\nlem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you\ncan solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by\nadapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions\nat the place where you are making it.\nFor this reason, we have tried to write each solution\nin a way which imposes nothing on you. It contains only\nthose essentials which cannot be avoided if you really\nXU\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to solve the problem. In this sense, we have tried,\nin each solution, to capture the invariant property com-\nmon to all places which succeed in solving the problem.\nBut of course, we have not always succeeded. The\nsolutions we have given to these problems vary in signif-\ncance, Some are more true, more profound, more cer-\ntain, than others. To show this clearly we have marked\nevery pattern, in the text itself, with two asterisks, or one\nasterisk, or no asterisks.\nIn the patterns marked with two asterisks, we believe\nthat we have succeeded in stating a true invariant: in\nshort, that the solution we have stated summarizes a\nproperty common to all possible ways of solving the\nstated problem. In these two-asterisk cases we believe,\nin short, that it is not possible to solve the stated prob-\nlem properly, without shaping the environment in one\nway or another according to the pattern that we have\ngiven—and that, in these cases, the pattern describes\na deep and inescapable property of a well-formed en-\nvironment.\nIn the patterns marked with one asterisk, we believe\nthat we have made some progress towards identifying\nsuch an invariant: but that with careful work it will\ncertainly be possible to improve on the solution, In\nthese cases, we believe it would be wise for you to treat\nthe pattern with a certain amount of disrespect—and\nthat you seek out variants of the solution which we have\ngiven, since there are almost certainly possible ranges of\nsolutions which are not covered by what we have written.\nFinally, in the patterns without an asterisk, we are\ncertain that we have mot succeeded in defining a true\nx1V\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\ninvariant—that, on the contrary, there are certainly ways\nof solving the problem different from the one which we\nhave given. In these cases we have still stated a solution,\nin order to be concrete—to provide the reader with at\nleast one way of solving the problem-—but the task of\nfinding the true invariant, the true property which hes\nat the heart of all possible solutions to this problem, re-\nmains undone.\nWe hope, of course, that many of the people who\nread, and use this language, will try to improve these\npatterns—will put their energy to work, in this task of\nfinding more true, more profound invariants—and we\nhope that gradually these more true patterns, which are\nslowly discovered, as time goes on, will enter a common\nlanguage, which all of us can share.\nYou see then that the patterns are very much alive\nand evolving. In fact, if you like, each pattern may be\nlooked upon as a hypothesis like one of the hypotheses of\nscience. In this sense, each pattern represents our current\nbest guess as to what arrangement of the physical envi-\nronment will work to solve the problem presented. The\nempirical questions center on the problem—does it occur\nand is it felt in the way we have described it?—-and the\nsolution—-does the arrangement we propose in fact re-\nsolve the problem? And the asterisks represent our\ndegree of faith in these hypotheses. But of course, no\nmatter what the asterisks say, the patterns are still\nhypotheses, all 253 of them-—-and are therefore all\ntentative, all free to evolve under the impact of new\nexperience and observation.\nLet us finally explain the status of this language, why\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwe have called it “A Pattern Language” with the em-\nphasis on the word “A,” and how we imagine this pat-\ntern language might be related to the countless thou-\nsands of other languages we hope that people will make\nfor themselves, in the future.\nThe Timeless Way of Building says that every society\nwhich is alive and whole, will have its own unique and\ndistinct pattern language; and further, that every in-\ndividual in such a society will have a unique language,\nshared in part, but which as a totality is unique to the\nraind of the person who has it. In this sense, in a healthy\nsociety there will be as many pattern languages as there\nare people—even though these languages are shared and\nsimular,\nThe question then arises: What exactly is the status\nof this published language? In what frame of mind, and\nwith what intention, are we publishing this language\nhere? The fact that it is published as a book means that\nmany thousands of people can use it. Is it not true that\nthere is a danger that people might come to rely on this\none printed language, instead of developing their own\nlanguages, in their own minds?\nThe fact is, that we have written this book as a first\nstep in the society-wide process by which people will\ngradually become conscious of their own pattern lan-\nguages, and work to improve them. We believe, and\nhave explained in The Timeless Way of Building, that\nthe languages which people have today are so brutal, and\nso fragmented, that most people no longer have any\nlanguage to speak of at all—and what they do have is\nnot based on human, or natural considerations.\nXVI\n& PATTERN LANGUAGE\nWe have spent years trying to formulate this lan-\nguage, in the hope that when a person uses tt, he will\nbe so impressed by its power, and so joyful in its use,\nthat he will understand again, what it means to have a\nliving language of this kind. [If we only succeed in that,\nit is possible that each person may once again embark on\nthe construction and development of his own language—\nperhaps taking the language printed in this book, as a\npoint of departure.\nAnd yet, we do believe, of course, that this language\nwhich is printed here is something more than a manual,\nor a teacher, or a version of a possible pattern language.\nMany of the patterns here are archetypal—so deep, so\ndeeply rooted in the nature of things, that it seems likely\nthat they will be a part of human nature, and human ac-\ntion, as much in five hundred years, as they are today.\nWe doubt very much whether anyone could construct\na valid pattern language, in his own mind, which did\nnot include the pattern arcapes (119) for example, or\nthe pattern aLcoves (179).\nIn this sense, we have also tried to penetrate, as deep\nas we are able, into the nature of things in the environ-\nment: and hope that a great part of this language, which\nwe print here, will be a core of any sensible human pat-\ntern language, which any person constructs for himself,\nin his own mind. In this sense, at least a part of the\nlanguage we have presented here, is the archetypal core\nof all possible pattern languages, which can make people\nfeel alive and human.\nXVII\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nA pattern language has the structure of a network. This\nis explained fully in The Timeless Way of Bualdimg.\nHowever, when we use the network of a language, we\nalways use it as a sequence, going through the patterns,\nmoving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,\nalways from the ones which create structures, to the ones\nwhich then embellish those structures, and then to those\nwhich embellish the embellishments. . . .\nSince the language is in truth a network, there is no\none sequence which perfectly captures it. But the se-\nquence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the\nfull network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down,\ndips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little\nlike a needle following a tapestry.\nThe sequence of patterns is both a summary of the\nlanguage, and at the same time, an index to the patterns.\nIf you read through the sentences which connect the\ngroups of patterns to one another, you will get an over-\nview of the whole language. And once you get this over-\nview, you will then be able to find the patterns which\nare relevant to your own project.\nAnd finally, as we shall explain in the next section,\nthis sequence of patterns is also the “base map,” from\nKVL\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nwhich you can make a language for your own project,\nby choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,\nand leaving them more or less in the order that you\nfind them printed here.\nWe begin with that part of the language which defines\na town or community. These patterns can never be “de-\nsigned” or “buil?” in one fell swoop—but patient piece-\nmeal growth, designed in such a way that every indi-\nvidual act is always helping to create or generate these\nlarger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the\nyears, make a community that has these global patterns\nin tk.\nI.

They create\na coherent picture of an entire region, with the power\nto generate such regions in a million forms, with in-\nfinite variety in all the details.\nIt 1s also true that any small sequence of patterns from\nthis language is itself a language for a smaller part of\nthe environment; and this small list of patterns is then\ncapable of generating a million parks, paths, houses,\nworkshops, or gardens.\nFor example, consider the following ten patterns:\nPRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET (140)\nSUNNY PLACE (161)\nOUTDOOR ROOM (163)\nSIX-FOOT BALCONY (167)\nPATHS AND GOALS (120)\nCEILING HEIGHT VARIETY (190)\nCOLUMNS AT THE CORNERS (212)\nFRONT DOOR BENCH (242)\nRAISED FLOWERS (245)\nDIFFERENT CHAIRS (251)\nThis short list of patterns is itself a language: it is one\nof a thousand possible languages for a porch, at the front\nof a house, One of us chose this small language, to build\nAXERV\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBYJECT\na porch onto the front of his house. This is the way the\nlanguage, and its patterns, helped to generate this porch.\nI started with PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE sTREET (140). That\npattern calls for a terrace, slightly raised, connected to the house,\nand on the street side. suNNY PLACE (161) suggests that a special\nplace on the sunny side of the yard should be intensified and\nmade into a place by the use of a patio, balcony, outdoor room,\netc, | used these two patterns to locate a raised platform on the\nsouth side of the house.\nit half under the existing roof overhang, and kept a mature\npyracanthus tree right smack in the middle of the platform. The\noverhead foliage of the tree added to the roof-like enclosure of\nthe space. I put a wind screen of fixed glass on the west side of\nthe platform too, to give it even more enclosure.\nplatform. But this pattern had to be used judiciously and not\nblindly—the reasoning for the pattern has to do with the mini-\nmum space required for people to sit comfortably and carry on a\ndiscussion around a small side-table. Since 1 wanted space for at\nleast two of these conversation areas—one under the roof for very\nfeet square.\nNow PATHS AND Goats (120): Usually, this pattern deals with\nlarge paths in a neighborhood, and comes much earlier in a lan-\nguage. But I used it in a special way. It says that the paths which\nnaturally get formed by people’s walking, on the land, should be\npreserved and intensified. Since the path to our front door cut\nright across the corner of the place where 1 had planned to put\nthe platform, 1 cut the corner of the platform aff.\nThe height of the platform above the ground was determined\nby CEILING HEIGHT varieETY (190). By building the platform\napproximately one foot above the ground line, the ceiling height\nof the covered portion came out at between 6 and 7 feet——just\nright for a space as small as this. Since this height above the\nBOOR BENCH (242) was automatically satisfied.\nThere were three columns standing, supporting the roof over\nXXXVI]ground level is just about right for sitting, the pattern FRONT\nhot or rainy days, and one out under the sky for days when you\nwanted to be full in the sun, the balcony had to be made 12 x 12\nI used six-Foor BaLcony (167) to determine the size of the\nTo make this platform into an ovTsoor Room (163), I put\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nthe old porch, They had to stay where they are, because they hold\nthe roof up. But, following covumns ar THE coRNERs (212),\nthe platform was very carefully tailored to their positions—so that\nthe columns help define the social spaces on either side of them.\nFinally, we put a couple of flower boxes next to the “front door\nbench”—it’s nice to smell them when you sit there—according to\nRAISED FLowERs (245). And the old chairs you can see in the\nporch are DIeFERENT CHAIRS (251).\nYou can see, from this short example, how powerful\nand simple a pattern language is, And you are now,\nperhaps ready to appreciate how careful you must be,\nwhen you construct a language for yourself and your\nown project.\nThe character of the porch is given by the ten patterns\nin this short language. In just this way, each part of the\nenvironment is given its character by the collection of\npatterns which we choose to build into it. The character\nof what you build, will be given to it by the language of\npatterns you use, to generate it.\nXxxvii\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nFor this reason, of course, the task of choosing a lan-\nguage for your project is fundamental. The pattern lan-\nguage we have given here contains 253 patterns. You\ncan therefore use it to generate an almost unimaginably\nlarge number of possible different smaller languages,\nfor all the different projects you may choose to do,\nsimply by picking patterns from it.\nWe shall now describe a rough procedure by which\nyou can choose a language for your own project, first by\ntaking patterns from this language we have printed here,\nand then by adding patterns of your own.\nr. First of all, make a copy of the master sequence\n(pages xix-xxxiv) on which you can tick off the patterns\nwhich will form the language for your project. If you\ndon’t have access to a copying machine, you can tick off\npatterns in the list printed in the book, use paper clips\nto mark pages, write your own list, use paper markers—\nwhatever you like. But just for now, to explain it clearly,\nwe shall assume that you have a copy of the list in front\nof you.\n2. Scan down the list, and find the pattern which\nbest describes the overall scope of the project you have\nin mind, This is the starting pattern for your project.\nTick it. CIE there are two or three possible candidates,\ndon’t worry: just pick the one which seems best: the\nothers will fall in place as you move forward.)\n3. Turn to the starting pattern itself, in the book, and\nread it through. Notice that the other patterns men-\ntioned by name at the beginning and at the end, of the\npattern you are reading, are also possible candidates for\nyour language. The ones at the beginning will tend to be\n“larger” than your project. Don’t include them, unless\nXXXVI\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nyou have the power to help create these patterns, at least\nin a small way, in the world around your project. The\nones at the end are “smaller.” Almost all of them will\nbe important. Tick all of them, on your list, unless you\nhave some special reason for not wanting to include\nthem.\n4. Now your list has some more ticks on it. Turn to\nthe next highest pattern on the list which is ticked, and\nopen the book to that pattern. Once again, it will lead\nyou to other patterns. Once again, tick those which are\nrelevant—especially the ones which are “smaller” that\ncome at the end. As a general rule, do not tick the ones\nwhich are “larger” unless you can do something about\nthem, concretely, in your own project.\n5. When in doubt about a pattern, don’t include it.\nYour list can easily get too long: and if it does, it will\nbecome confusing. The list will be quite long enough,\neven if you only include the patterns you especially like.\n6. Keep going like this, until you have ticked all the\npatterns you want for your project.\n7. Now, adjust the sequence by adding your own ma-\nterial. If there are things you want to include in your\nproject, but you have not been able to find patterns which\ncorrespond to them, then write them in, at an appropri-\nate point in the sequence, near other patterns which are\nof about the same size and importance. For example,\nthere is no pattern for a sauna. If you want to include\none, write it in somewhere near BATHING ROOM (144)\nin your sequence.\n8. And of course, if you want to change any patterns,\nchange them. There are often cases where you may have\na personal version of a pattern, which is more true, or\nXXXIN\nCHOCSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nmore relevant for you. In this case, you will get the most\n“power” over the language, and make it your own most\neffectively, if you write the changes in, at the appropri-\nate places in the book. And, it will be most concrete of\nall, if you change the name of the pattern too—so that\nit captures your own changes clearly.\nyp oe\nSuppose now that you have a language for your proj-\nect. The way to use the language depends very much\non its scale. Patterns dealing with towns can only be\nimplemented gradually, by grass roots action; patterns\nfor a building can be built up in your mind, and marked\nout on the ground; patterns for construction must be\nbuilt physically, on the site. For this reason we have\ngiven three separate instructions, for these three different\nscales. For towns, see page 3; for buildings, see page\n463; for construction, see page 935.\nThe procedures for each of these three scales are de-\nscribed in much more detail with extensive examples,\nin the appropriate chapters of The Timeless Way of\nBuilding. For the town—see chapters 24 and 25; for an\nindividual building—see chapters 20, 21, and 22; and for\nthe process of construction which describes the way a\nbuilding is actually built see chapter 23.\nxh\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nFinally, a note of caution. This language, lke English,\ncan be a medium for prose, or a medium for poetry. The\ndifference between prose and poetry is not that different\nJanpuages are used, but that the same language is used,\ndifferently. In an ordinary English sentence, each word\nhas one meaning, and the sentence too, has one simple\nmeaning. In a poem, the meaning is far more dense.\nEach word carries several meanings; and the sentence\nas a Whole carries an enormous density of interlocking\nmeanings, which together illuminate the whole.\nThe same is true for pattern languages. It is possible\nto make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a\nrather loose way. A building made like this, is an as-\nsembly of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound.\nBut it 1s also possible to put patterns together in such a\nway that many many patterns overlap in the same\nphysical space: the building is very dense; it has many\nmeanings captured in a small space; and through this\ndensity, it becomes profound.\nIn a poern, this kind of density, creates illumination,\nby making identities between words, and meanings,\nwhose identity we have not understood before. In “O\nRose thou art sick,” the rose is identifed with many\nxii\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\ngreater, and more personal things than any rose—and\nthe poem illuminates the person, and the rose, because of\nthis connection. The connection not only illuminates the\nwords, but also illuminates our actual lives.\n© Rose thon art sick,\n‘The invisible worm,\nThat flies in the night\nin the howling storm:\nHas found out thy bed\nOF crimson joy:\nAnd his dark secret Jove\nDoes thy life destroy,\nWILLIAM BLAKE\nThe same exactly, happens in a building, Consider, for\nexample, the two patterns BATHING ROOM (144) and\nSTILL WATER (71). One defines a part of a house where\nyou can bathe yourself slowly, with pleasure, perhaps\nin company; a place to rest your limbs, and to relax. The\nother is a place in a neighborhood, where this is water\nto gaze into, perhaps to swim in, where children can sail\nboats, and splash about, which nourishes those parts of\nourselves which rely on water as one of the great\nelements of the unconscious.\nSuppose now, that we make a complex of buildings\nwhere individual bathing rooms are somehow connected\nto a common pond, or lake, or pool—where the bathing\nroom merges with this common place; where there is no\nsharp distinction between the individual and family pro-\ncesses of the bathing room, and the common pleasure\nof the common pool. In this place, these two patterns\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nexist in the same space; they are identified, there is a\ncompression of the two, which requires less space, and\nwhich is more profound than in a place where they are\nmerely side by side. The compression illuminates each\nof the patterns, sheds light on its meaning; and also i-\nluminates our lives, as we understand a little more about\nthe connections of our inner needs.\nBut this kind of compression is not only poetic and\nprofound. It is not only the stuff of poems and exotic\nstatements, but to some degree, the stuff of every English\nsentence. To some depree, there is compression in every\nsingle word we utter, just because each word carries the\nwhisper of the meanings of the words it is connected to.\nEven “Please pass the butter, Fred” has some compres-\nsion in it, because it carries overtones that lie in the con-\nnections of these words to all the words which came be-\nfore it.\nFach of us, talking to our friends, or to our families,\nmakes use of these compressions, which are drawn out\nfrom the connections between words which are given by\nthe language. The more we can feel all the connections\nin the language, the more rich and subtle are the things\nwe say at the most ordinary times.\nAnd once again, the same is true in building. The com-\npression of patterns into a single space, is not a poetic\nand exotic thing, kept for special buildings which are\nworks of art. It is the most ordinary economy of space. It\nis quite possible that all the patterns for a house might,\nin some form be present, and overlapping, in a simple\none-room cabin, The patterns do not need to be strung\nout, and kept separate. Every building, every room,\nxd\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nevery garden is better, when all the patterns which it\nneeds are compressed as far as it is possible for them to\nbe. The building will be cheaper; and the meanings in it\nwill be denser.\nIt is essential then, once you have learned to use the\nlanguage, that you pay attention to the possibility of\ncompressing the many patterns which you put together,\nin the smallest possible space. You may think of this\nprocess of compressing patterns, as a way to make the\ncheapest possible building which has the necessary pat-\nterns in it. It is, also, the only way of using a pattern\nlanguage to make buildings which are poems.\n","summary":"This chunk discusses the pattern of \"Ring Roads\" and how it relates to the larger network of transportation and learning in a city, as described in the book \"A Pattern Language\".","chunk":"# 17 Ring Roads\n\n![39_Image_0.Png](39_Image_0.Png)\n\n. . . the ring roads which this pattern specifies, help to define and generate the LOCAL TRANSPORT AREAS (II); if they are placed to make connections between INTERCHANGES (34), they also help to form the WEB OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION (16).\n\nIt is not possible to avoid the need for high speed roads in modern society; but it is essential to place them and build them in such a way that they do not destroy communities or countryside.\n\nEven though the rush of freeways and superhighways built in the 1950's and 1960's is slowing down, because of widespread local protest, we cannot avoid high speed roads altogether. There is, at present, no prospect for a viable alternative which can provide for the vast volume of movement of cars and trucks and buses which a modern city lives on economically and socially.\n\nAt the same time, however, high speed roads do enormous damage when they are badly placed. They slice communities in half; they cut off waterfronts; they cut off access to the countryside; and, above all, they create enormous noise. For hundreds of yards, even a mile or two, the noise of every superhighway roars in the background.\n\nTo resolve these obvious dilemmas that come with the location and construction of high speed roads, we must find ways of building and locating these roads, so that they do not destroy communities and shatter life with their noise. We can give three requirements that, we believe, go to the heart of this policy:\nI. Every community that has coherence as an area of local transportation-LOCAL TRANSPORT AREAS (11)-is never split by a high speed road, but rather has at least one high speed road adjacent to it. This allows rapid auto travel from one such community out to other communities and to the region at large.\n\n2. It must be possible for residents of each local transport area to reach the open countryside without crossing a high speed road-see ciry country FINGERS (3). This means, very roughly,\n\nthat high speed roads must always be placed in such positions that at least one side of every local transport area has direct access to open country.\n\n3. Most important of all, high speed roads must be shielded acoustically to protect the life around them. This means that they must either be sunken, or shielded by earth berms, parking structures, or warehouses, which will not be damaged by the moise.\n\nTherefore:\nPlace high speed roads (freeways and other major arteries) so that:\nI. At least one high speed road lies tangent to each local transport area.\n\n2. Each local transport area has at least one side not bounded by a high speed road, but directly open to the countryside.\n\n3. The road is always sunken, or shielded along its length by berms, or earth, or industrial buildings, to protect the nearby neighborhoods from noise.\n\n![41_image_0.png](41_image_0.png)\n\n* * *\nAlways place the high speed roads on boundaries between subcultures-subculture Boundary (13) and never along waterfronts-ACCESS TO WATER (25). Place industry and big parking garages next to the roads, and use them, whenever possible, as extra noise shields-INDUSTRIAL RIBBONS (42), SHIELDED PARK-\nING (c ) . . . .\n\n18   NETWORK  OF  LEARNING*\n\n![42_image_0.png](42_image_0.png)\n\n. . . another network, not physical like transportation, but conceptual, and equal in importance, is the network of learning: the thousands of interconnected situations that occur all over the city, and which in fact comprise the city's \"curriculum\": the way of life it teaches to its young.\n\nIn a society which emphasizes teaching, children and students-and adults-become passive and unable to think or act for themselves. Creative, active individuals can only grow up in a society which emphasizes learning instead of teaching.\n\nThere is no need to add to the criticism of our public schools. The critique is extensive and can hardly be improved on. The processes of learning and teaching, too, have been exhaustively studied. . The question now is what to do. (George Dennison, Lives of Children, New York: Vintage Books, 1969, p. 3.)\nTo date, the most penetrating analysis and proposal for an alternative framework for education comes from Ivan Illich in his book, De-Schooling Society, and his article, \"Education without Schools: How It Can Be Done,\" in the New York Review of Books, New York, 15 (12): 25-31, special supplement, July 1971.\n\nIllich describes a style of learning that is quite the opposite from schools. It is geared especially to the rich opportunities for learning that are natural to every metropolitan area:\nThe alternative to social control through the schools is the voluntary participation in society through networks which provide access to all its resources for learning. In fact these networks now exist, but they are rarely used for educational purposes. The crisis of schooling, if it is to have any positive consequence, will inevitably lead to their incorporation into the educational process. . . .\n\nSchools are designed on the assumption that there is a secret to everything in life; that the quality of life depends on knowing that secret; that secrets can be known only in orderly successions; and that only teachers can properly reveal these secrets. An individual with a schooled mind conceives of the world as a pyramid of classified packages accessible only to those who carry the proper tags.\n\n## I Oo\n\nNew educational institutions would break apart this pyramid. Their purpose must be to facilitate access for the learner: to allow him to look into the windows of the control room or the parlsament, if he cannot get in the door. Moreover, such new institutions should be channels to which the learner would have access without credentials or pedigree-public spaces in which peers and elders outside his immediate horizon now become available. . . .\n\nWhile network administrators would concentrate primarily on the building and maintenance of roads providing access to resources, the pedagogue would help the student to find the path which for him could lead fastest to his goal. If a student wants to learn spoken Cantonese from a Chinese neighbor, the pedagogue would be available to judge their proficiency, and to help them select the textbook and methods most suitable to their talents, character, and the time available for study. He can counsel the would-be airplane mechanic on finding the best places for apprenticeship. He can recommend books to somebody who wants to find challenging peers to discuss African history. Like the network administrator, the pedagogical counselor conceives of himself as a professional educator. Access to either could be gained by individuals through the use of educational vouchers. . . .\n\nIn addition to the tentative conclusions of the Carnegie Commission reports, the last year has brought forth a series of important documents which show that responsible people are becoming aware of the fact that schooling for certification cannot continue to be counted upon as the central educational device of a modern society.\n\nJulius Nyere of Tanzania has announced plans to integrate education with the life of the village. In Canada, the Wright Commission on post-secondary education has reported that no known system of formal education could provide equal opportunities for the citizens of Ontario. The president of Peru has accepted the recommendation of his commission on education, which proposes to abolish free schools in favor of free educational opportunities provided throughout life. In fact he is reported to have insisted that this program proceed slowly at first in order to keep teachers in school and out of the way of true educators. (Abridged from pp. 76 and 99 in Deschooling Society by Ivan Illich. Vol. 44 in World Perspectives Series, edited by Ruth Nanda Anshen, New York: Harper & Row, 1971.)\nIn short, the educational system so radically decentralized becomes congruent with the urban structure itself. People of all walks of life come forth, and offer a class in the things they know and love: professionals and workgroups offer apprenticeships in their offices and workshops, old people offer to teach whatever their life work and interest has been, specialists offer tutoring in their special subjects. Living and learning are the\n\nsame. It is not hard to imagine that eventually every third or fourth household will have at least one person in it who is offering a class or training of some kind.\n\nTherefore:\nInstead of the lock-step of compulsory schooling in a fixed place, work in piecemeal ways to decentralize the process of learning and enrich it through contact with many places and people all over the city: workshops, teachers at home or walking through the city, professionals willing to take on the young as helpers, older children teaching younger children, museums, youth groups traveling, scholarly seminars, industrial workshops, old people, and so on. Conceive of all these situations as forming the backbone of the learning process; survey all these situations, describe them, and publish them as the city's \"curriculum\"; then let students, children, their families and neighborhoods weave together for themselves the situations that comprise their \"school\" paying as they go with standard vouchers, raised by community tax. Build new educational facilities in a way which extends and enriches this network.\n\n![45_image_0.png](45_image_0.png)\n\n* * *\nAbove all, encourage the formation of seminars and workshops in people's homes-HOME WORKSHOP (157); make sure that\n\neach city has a \"path\" where young children can safely wander on their own-children in THE CITY (57); build extra public\n\"homes\" for children, one to every neighborhood at least-\nCHILDREN'S HOME (86); create a large number of work-oriented small schools in those parts of town dominated by work and commercial activity-shopFRoNT schools (85); encourage teenagers to work out a self-organized learning society of their own -TEENAGE SOCIETY (84); treat the university as scattered adult learning for all the adults in the region-UNIVERSITY AS A\nMARKETPLACE (43); and use the real work of professionals and tradesmen as the basic nodes in the network-MASTER AND AP- PRENTICES (83). . . .","embeddings":[null]},{"document":"A PATTERN LANGUAGE\nVolume 1, The Timeless Way of Building, and Volume\n2, 4 Patrern Language, are two halves of a single work.\nThis book provides a language, for building and plan-\nning; the other book provides the theory and instruc-\ntions for the use of the language. This book. describes the\ndetailed patterns for towns and neighborhoods, houses,\ngardens, and rooms. The other book explains the disci-\npline which makes it possible to use these patterns to\ncreate a building or a town. This book is the sourcebook of\nthe timeless way; the other is its practice and its origin.\nThe two books have evolved very much in parallel.\nThey have been growing over the last eight years, as\nwe have worked on the one hand to understand the\nnature of the building process, and on the other hand to\nconstruct an actual, possible pattern language. We have\nbeen forced by practical considerations, to publish these\ntwo books under separate covers; but in fact, they form\nan indivisible whole. It is possible to read them sepa-\nrately. But to gain the insight which we have tried to\ncommunicate in them, it is essential that you read them\nboth.\nThe Timeless Way of Building describes the funda-\nmental nature of the task of making towns and buildings.\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nIt is shown there, that towns and buildings will not be\nable to become alive, unless they are made by all the\npeople in society, and unless these people share a com-\nmon pattern language, within which to make these\nbuildings, and unless this cornmon pattern language is\nalive itself.\nTn this book, we present one possible pattern language,\nof the kind called for in The Timeless Way. This lan-\nguage is extremely practical. It is a language that we\nhave distilled from our own building and planning ef-\nforts over the last eight years. You can use it to work\nwith your neighbors, to improve your town and neighbor-\nhood. You can use it to design a house for yourself,\nwith your family; or to work with other people to de-\nsign an office or a workshop or a public building like a\nschool. And you can use it to guide you in the actual\nprocess of construction.\nThe elements of this language are entities called pat-\nterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs\nover and over again in our environment, and then\ndescribes the core of the solution to that problem, in such\na way that you can use this solution a million times over,\nwithout ever doing it the same way twice.\nFor convenience and clarity, each pattern has the same\nformat. First, there is a picture, which shows an arche-\ntypal example of that pattern. Second, after the picture,\neach pattern has an introductory paragraph, which sets\nthe context for the pattern, by explaining how it helps\nto complete certain larger patterns. Then there are three\ndiamonds to mark the beginning of the problem. After\nthe diamonds there is a headline, in bold type. This\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nheadline gives the essence of the problem in one or two\nsentences. After the headline comes the body of the\nproblem. This is the longest section. It describes the\nempirical background of the pattern, the evidence for its\nvalidity, the range of different ways the pattern can be\nmanifested in a building, and so on. Then, again in\nbold type, like the headline, is the solution—the heart\nof the pattern—which describes the field of physical and\nsocial relationships which are required to solve the stated\nproblem, in the stated context. This solution is always\nexactly what you need to do, to build the pattern. Then,\nafter the solution, there is a diagram, which shows the\nsolution in the form of a diagram, with labels to indicate\nits main components.\nAfter the diagram, another three diamonds, to show\nthat the main body of the pattern is finished. And finally,\nafter the diamonds there is a paragraph which ties the\npattern to all those smaller patterns in the language,\nwhich are needed to complete this pattern, to embellish\nit, to All it out.\nThere are two essential purposes behind this format.\nFirst, to present each pattern connected to other patterns,\nso that you grasp the collection of all 253 patterns as a\nwhole, as a language, within which you can create an in-\nfinite variety of combinations. Second, to present the\nproblem and solution of each pattern in such a way that\nyou can judge it for yourself, and modify it, without\nlosing the essence that is central to it.\nLet us next understand the nature of the connection\nbetween patterns.\nXI\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nThe patterns are ordered, beginning with the very\nlargest, for regions and towns, then working down\nthrough neighborhoods, clusters of buildings, buildings,\nrooms and alcoves, ending finally with details of con-\nstruction.\nThis order, which is presented as a straight linear\nsequerice, is essential to the way the language works. It is\npresented, and explained more fully, in the next section.\nWhat is most important about this sequence, is that it is\nbased on the connections between the patterns. Each\npattern is connected to certain “larger” patterns which\ncome above it in the language; and to certain “smaller”\npatterns which come below it in the language. The pat-\ntern helps to complete those larger patterns which are\n“above” it, and is itself completed by those smaller pat-\nterns which are “below” it.\nThus, for example, you will find that the pattern ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN (60), is connected first to certain larger\npatterns: SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY (13), IDENTIFIABLE\nNEIGHBORHOOD (14), WORK COMMUNITY (41), and\nquirr Backs (59). These appear on its first page. And it\nis also connected to certain smaller patterns: PosiTIVE\nOUTDOOR SPACE (107), TREE PLACES (171), and GARDEN\nWALL (173). These appear on its last page.\nWhat this means, is that IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBOR-\nHOOD, SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, WORK COMMUNITY, and\nQUIET BACKS are incomplete, unless they contain an ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN; and that an ACCESSIBLE GREEN is itself\nincomplete, unless it contains POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nAnd what it means in practical terms is that, if you\nx\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to lay out a green according to this pattern, you\nmust not only follow the instructions which describe the\npattern itself, but must also try to embed the green\nWithin an IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD or in some sUB-\nCULTURE BOUNDARY, and in a way that helps to form\nquizr Backs; and then you must work to complete the\ngreen by building in some posiTIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nIn short, no pattern is an isolated entity. Each pattern\ncan exist in the world, only to the extent that is sup-\nported by other patterns: the larger patterns in which it\nis embedded, the patterns of the same size that surround\nit, and the smaller patterns which are embedded in it.\nThis is a fundamental view of the world, It says that\nwhen you build a thing you cannot merely build that\nthing in isolation, but must also repair the world around\nit, and within it, so that the larger world at that one\nplace becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the\nthing which you make takes its place in the web of na-\nture, as you make it.\nNow we explain the nature of the relation between\nproblems and solutions, within the individual patterns.\nEach solution is stated in such a way that it gives the\nessential field of relationships needed to solve the prob-\nlem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you\ncan solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by\nadapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions\nat the place where you are making it.\nFor this reason, we have tried to write each solution\nin a way which imposes nothing on you. It contains only\nthose essentials which cannot be avoided if you really\nXU\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to solve the problem. In this sense, we have tried,\nin each solution, to capture the invariant property com-\nmon to all places which succeed in solving the problem.\nBut of course, we have not always succeeded. The\nsolutions we have given to these problems vary in signif-\ncance, Some are more true, more profound, more cer-\ntain, than others. To show this clearly we have marked\nevery pattern, in the text itself, with two asterisks, or one\nasterisk, or no asterisks.\nIn the patterns marked with two asterisks, we believe\nthat we have succeeded in stating a true invariant: in\nshort, that the solution we have stated summarizes a\nproperty common to all possible ways of solving the\nstated problem. In these two-asterisk cases we believe,\nin short, that it is not possible to solve the stated prob-\nlem properly, without shaping the environment in one\nway or another according to the pattern that we have\ngiven—and that, in these cases, the pattern describes\na deep and inescapable property of a well-formed en-\nvironment.\nIn the patterns marked with one asterisk, we believe\nthat we have made some progress towards identifying\nsuch an invariant: but that with careful work it will\ncertainly be possible to improve on the solution, In\nthese cases, we believe it would be wise for you to treat\nthe pattern with a certain amount of disrespect—and\nthat you seek out variants of the solution which we have\ngiven, since there are almost certainly possible ranges of\nsolutions which are not covered by what we have written.\nFinally, in the patterns without an asterisk, we are\ncertain that we have mot succeeded in defining a true\nx1V\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\ninvariant—that, on the contrary, there are certainly ways\nof solving the problem different from the one which we\nhave given. In these cases we have still stated a solution,\nin order to be concrete—to provide the reader with at\nleast one way of solving the problem-—but the task of\nfinding the true invariant, the true property which hes\nat the heart of all possible solutions to this problem, re-\nmains undone.\nWe hope, of course, that many of the people who\nread, and use this language, will try to improve these\npatterns—will put their energy to work, in this task of\nfinding more true, more profound invariants—and we\nhope that gradually these more true patterns, which are\nslowly discovered, as time goes on, will enter a common\nlanguage, which all of us can share.\nYou see then that the patterns are very much alive\nand evolving. In fact, if you like, each pattern may be\nlooked upon as a hypothesis like one of the hypotheses of\nscience. In this sense, each pattern represents our current\nbest guess as to what arrangement of the physical envi-\nronment will work to solve the problem presented. The\nempirical questions center on the problem—does it occur\nand is it felt in the way we have described it?—-and the\nsolution—-does the arrangement we propose in fact re-\nsolve the problem? And the asterisks represent our\ndegree of faith in these hypotheses. But of course, no\nmatter what the asterisks say, the patterns are still\nhypotheses, all 253 of them-—-and are therefore all\ntentative, all free to evolve under the impact of new\nexperience and observation.\nLet us finally explain the status of this language, why\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwe have called it “A Pattern Language” with the em-\nphasis on the word “A,” and how we imagine this pat-\ntern language might be related to the countless thou-\nsands of other languages we hope that people will make\nfor themselves, in the future.\nThe Timeless Way of Building says that every society\nwhich is alive and whole, will have its own unique and\ndistinct pattern language; and further, that every in-\ndividual in such a society will have a unique language,\nshared in part, but which as a totality is unique to the\nraind of the person who has it. In this sense, in a healthy\nsociety there will be as many pattern languages as there\nare people—even though these languages are shared and\nsimular,\nThe question then arises: What exactly is the status\nof this published language? In what frame of mind, and\nwith what intention, are we publishing this language\nhere? The fact that it is published as a book means that\nmany thousands of people can use it. Is it not true that\nthere is a danger that people might come to rely on this\none printed language, instead of developing their own\nlanguages, in their own minds?\nThe fact is, that we have written this book as a first\nstep in the society-wide process by which people will\ngradually become conscious of their own pattern lan-\nguages, and work to improve them. We believe, and\nhave explained in The Timeless Way of Building, that\nthe languages which people have today are so brutal, and\nso fragmented, that most people no longer have any\nlanguage to speak of at all—and what they do have is\nnot based on human, or natural considerations.\nXVI\n& PATTERN LANGUAGE\nWe have spent years trying to formulate this lan-\nguage, in the hope that when a person uses tt, he will\nbe so impressed by its power, and so joyful in its use,\nthat he will understand again, what it means to have a\nliving language of this kind. [If we only succeed in that,\nit is possible that each person may once again embark on\nthe construction and development of his own language—\nperhaps taking the language printed in this book, as a\npoint of departure.\nAnd yet, we do believe, of course, that this language\nwhich is printed here is something more than a manual,\nor a teacher, or a version of a possible pattern language.\nMany of the patterns here are archetypal—so deep, so\ndeeply rooted in the nature of things, that it seems likely\nthat they will be a part of human nature, and human ac-\ntion, as much in five hundred years, as they are today.\nWe doubt very much whether anyone could construct\na valid pattern language, in his own mind, which did\nnot include the pattern arcapes (119) for example, or\nthe pattern aLcoves (179).\nIn this sense, we have also tried to penetrate, as deep\nas we are able, into the nature of things in the environ-\nment: and hope that a great part of this language, which\nwe print here, will be a core of any sensible human pat-\ntern language, which any person constructs for himself,\nin his own mind. In this sense, at least a part of the\nlanguage we have presented here, is the archetypal core\nof all possible pattern languages, which can make people\nfeel alive and human.\nXVII\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nA pattern language has the structure of a network. This\nis explained fully in The Timeless Way of Bualdimg.\nHowever, when we use the network of a language, we\nalways use it as a sequence, going through the patterns,\nmoving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,\nalways from the ones which create structures, to the ones\nwhich then embellish those structures, and then to those\nwhich embellish the embellishments. . . .\nSince the language is in truth a network, there is no\none sequence which perfectly captures it. But the se-\nquence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the\nfull network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down,\ndips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little\nlike a needle following a tapestry.\nThe sequence of patterns is both a summary of the\nlanguage, and at the same time, an index to the patterns.\nIf you read through the sentences which connect the\ngroups of patterns to one another, you will get an over-\nview of the whole language. And once you get this over-\nview, you will then be able to find the patterns which\nare relevant to your own project.\nAnd finally, as we shall explain in the next section,\nthis sequence of patterns is also the “base map,” from\nKVL\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nwhich you can make a language for your own project,\nby choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,\nand leaving them more or less in the order that you\nfind them printed here.\nWe begin with that part of the language which defines\na town or community. These patterns can never be “de-\nsigned” or “buil?” in one fell swoop—but patient piece-\nmeal growth, designed in such a way that every indi-\nvidual act is always helping to create or generate these\nlarger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the\nyears, make a community that has these global patterns\nin tk.\nI.

They create\na coherent picture of an entire region, with the power\nto generate such regions in a million forms, with in-\nfinite variety in all the details.\nIt 1s also true that any small sequence of patterns from\nthis language is itself a language for a smaller part of\nthe environment; and this small list of patterns is then\ncapable of generating a million parks, paths, houses,\nworkshops, or gardens.\nFor example, consider the following ten patterns:\nPRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET (140)\nSUNNY PLACE (161)\nOUTDOOR ROOM (163)\nSIX-FOOT BALCONY (167)\nPATHS AND GOALS (120)\nCEILING HEIGHT VARIETY (190)\nCOLUMNS AT THE CORNERS (212)\nFRONT DOOR BENCH (242)\nRAISED FLOWERS (245)\nDIFFERENT CHAIRS (251)\nThis short list of patterns is itself a language: it is one\nof a thousand possible languages for a porch, at the front\nof a house, One of us chose this small language, to build\nAXERV\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBYJECT\na porch onto the front of his house. This is the way the\nlanguage, and its patterns, helped to generate this porch.\nI started with PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE sTREET (140). That\npattern calls for a terrace, slightly raised, connected to the house,\nand on the street side. suNNY PLACE (161) suggests that a special\nplace on the sunny side of the yard should be intensified and\nmade into a place by the use of a patio, balcony, outdoor room,\netc, | used these two patterns to locate a raised platform on the\nsouth side of the house.\nit half under the existing roof overhang, and kept a mature\npyracanthus tree right smack in the middle of the platform. The\noverhead foliage of the tree added to the roof-like enclosure of\nthe space. I put a wind screen of fixed glass on the west side of\nthe platform too, to give it even more enclosure.\nplatform. But this pattern had to be used judiciously and not\nblindly—the reasoning for the pattern has to do with the mini-\nmum space required for people to sit comfortably and carry on a\ndiscussion around a small side-table. Since 1 wanted space for at\nleast two of these conversation areas—one under the roof for very\nfeet square.\nNow PATHS AND Goats (120): Usually, this pattern deals with\nlarge paths in a neighborhood, and comes much earlier in a lan-\nguage. But I used it in a special way. It says that the paths which\nnaturally get formed by people’s walking, on the land, should be\npreserved and intensified. Since the path to our front door cut\nright across the corner of the place where 1 had planned to put\nthe platform, 1 cut the corner of the platform aff.\nThe height of the platform above the ground was determined\nby CEILING HEIGHT varieETY (190). By building the platform\napproximately one foot above the ground line, the ceiling height\nof the covered portion came out at between 6 and 7 feet——just\nright for a space as small as this. Since this height above the\nBOOR BENCH (242) was automatically satisfied.\nThere were three columns standing, supporting the roof over\nXXXVI]ground level is just about right for sitting, the pattern FRONT\nhot or rainy days, and one out under the sky for days when you\nwanted to be full in the sun, the balcony had to be made 12 x 12\nI used six-Foor BaLcony (167) to determine the size of the\nTo make this platform into an ovTsoor Room (163), I put\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nthe old porch, They had to stay where they are, because they hold\nthe roof up. But, following covumns ar THE coRNERs (212),\nthe platform was very carefully tailored to their positions—so that\nthe columns help define the social spaces on either side of them.\nFinally, we put a couple of flower boxes next to the “front door\nbench”—it’s nice to smell them when you sit there—according to\nRAISED FLowERs (245). And the old chairs you can see in the\nporch are DIeFERENT CHAIRS (251).\nYou can see, from this short example, how powerful\nand simple a pattern language is, And you are now,\nperhaps ready to appreciate how careful you must be,\nwhen you construct a language for yourself and your\nown project.\nThe character of the porch is given by the ten patterns\nin this short language. In just this way, each part of the\nenvironment is given its character by the collection of\npatterns which we choose to build into it. The character\nof what you build, will be given to it by the language of\npatterns you use, to generate it.\nXxxvii\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nFor this reason, of course, the task of choosing a lan-\nguage for your project is fundamental. The pattern lan-\nguage we have given here contains 253 patterns. You\ncan therefore use it to generate an almost unimaginably\nlarge number of possible different smaller languages,\nfor all the different projects you may choose to do,\nsimply by picking patterns from it.\nWe shall now describe a rough procedure by which\nyou can choose a language for your own project, first by\ntaking patterns from this language we have printed here,\nand then by adding patterns of your own.\nr. First of all, make a copy of the master sequence\n(pages xix-xxxiv) on which you can tick off the patterns\nwhich will form the language for your project. If you\ndon’t have access to a copying machine, you can tick off\npatterns in the list printed in the book, use paper clips\nto mark pages, write your own list, use paper markers—\nwhatever you like. But just for now, to explain it clearly,\nwe shall assume that you have a copy of the list in front\nof you.\n2. Scan down the list, and find the pattern which\nbest describes the overall scope of the project you have\nin mind, This is the starting pattern for your project.\nTick it. CIE there are two or three possible candidates,\ndon’t worry: just pick the one which seems best: the\nothers will fall in place as you move forward.)\n3. Turn to the starting pattern itself, in the book, and\nread it through. Notice that the other patterns men-\ntioned by name at the beginning and at the end, of the\npattern you are reading, are also possible candidates for\nyour language. The ones at the beginning will tend to be\n“larger” than your project. Don’t include them, unless\nXXXVI\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nyou have the power to help create these patterns, at least\nin a small way, in the world around your project. The\nones at the end are “smaller.” Almost all of them will\nbe important. Tick all of them, on your list, unless you\nhave some special reason for not wanting to include\nthem.\n4. Now your list has some more ticks on it. Turn to\nthe next highest pattern on the list which is ticked, and\nopen the book to that pattern. Once again, it will lead\nyou to other patterns. Once again, tick those which are\nrelevant—especially the ones which are “smaller” that\ncome at the end. As a general rule, do not tick the ones\nwhich are “larger” unless you can do something about\nthem, concretely, in your own project.\n5. When in doubt about a pattern, don’t include it.\nYour list can easily get too long: and if it does, it will\nbecome confusing. The list will be quite long enough,\neven if you only include the patterns you especially like.\n6. Keep going like this, until you have ticked all the\npatterns you want for your project.\n7. Now, adjust the sequence by adding your own ma-\nterial. If there are things you want to include in your\nproject, but you have not been able to find patterns which\ncorrespond to them, then write them in, at an appropri-\nate point in the sequence, near other patterns which are\nof about the same size and importance. For example,\nthere is no pattern for a sauna. If you want to include\none, write it in somewhere near BATHING ROOM (144)\nin your sequence.\n8. And of course, if you want to change any patterns,\nchange them. There are often cases where you may have\na personal version of a pattern, which is more true, or\nXXXIN\nCHOCSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nmore relevant for you. In this case, you will get the most\n“power” over the language, and make it your own most\neffectively, if you write the changes in, at the appropri-\nate places in the book. And, it will be most concrete of\nall, if you change the name of the pattern too—so that\nit captures your own changes clearly.\nyp oe\nSuppose now that you have a language for your proj-\nect. The way to use the language depends very much\non its scale. Patterns dealing with towns can only be\nimplemented gradually, by grass roots action; patterns\nfor a building can be built up in your mind, and marked\nout on the ground; patterns for construction must be\nbuilt physically, on the site. For this reason we have\ngiven three separate instructions, for these three different\nscales. For towns, see page 3; for buildings, see page\n463; for construction, see page 935.\nThe procedures for each of these three scales are de-\nscribed in much more detail with extensive examples,\nin the appropriate chapters of The Timeless Way of\nBuilding. For the town—see chapters 24 and 25; for an\nindividual building—see chapters 20, 21, and 22; and for\nthe process of construction which describes the way a\nbuilding is actually built see chapter 23.\nxh\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nFinally, a note of caution. This language, lke English,\ncan be a medium for prose, or a medium for poetry. The\ndifference between prose and poetry is not that different\nJanpuages are used, but that the same language is used,\ndifferently. In an ordinary English sentence, each word\nhas one meaning, and the sentence too, has one simple\nmeaning. In a poem, the meaning is far more dense.\nEach word carries several meanings; and the sentence\nas a Whole carries an enormous density of interlocking\nmeanings, which together illuminate the whole.\nThe same is true for pattern languages. It is possible\nto make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a\nrather loose way. A building made like this, is an as-\nsembly of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound.\nBut it 1s also possible to put patterns together in such a\nway that many many patterns overlap in the same\nphysical space: the building is very dense; it has many\nmeanings captured in a small space; and through this\ndensity, it becomes profound.\nIn a poern, this kind of density, creates illumination,\nby making identities between words, and meanings,\nwhose identity we have not understood before. In “O\nRose thou art sick,” the rose is identifed with many\nxii\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\ngreater, and more personal things than any rose—and\nthe poem illuminates the person, and the rose, because of\nthis connection. The connection not only illuminates the\nwords, but also illuminates our actual lives.\n© Rose thon art sick,\n‘The invisible worm,\nThat flies in the night\nin the howling storm:\nHas found out thy bed\nOF crimson joy:\nAnd his dark secret Jove\nDoes thy life destroy,\nWILLIAM BLAKE\nThe same exactly, happens in a building, Consider, for\nexample, the two patterns BATHING ROOM (144) and\nSTILL WATER (71). One defines a part of a house where\nyou can bathe yourself slowly, with pleasure, perhaps\nin company; a place to rest your limbs, and to relax. The\nother is a place in a neighborhood, where this is water\nto gaze into, perhaps to swim in, where children can sail\nboats, and splash about, which nourishes those parts of\nourselves which rely on water as one of the great\nelements of the unconscious.\nSuppose now, that we make a complex of buildings\nwhere individual bathing rooms are somehow connected\nto a common pond, or lake, or pool—where the bathing\nroom merges with this common place; where there is no\nsharp distinction between the individual and family pro-\ncesses of the bathing room, and the common pleasure\nof the common pool. In this place, these two patterns\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nexist in the same space; they are identified, there is a\ncompression of the two, which requires less space, and\nwhich is more profound than in a place where they are\nmerely side by side. The compression illuminates each\nof the patterns, sheds light on its meaning; and also i-\nluminates our lives, as we understand a little more about\nthe connections of our inner needs.\nBut this kind of compression is not only poetic and\nprofound. It is not only the stuff of poems and exotic\nstatements, but to some degree, the stuff of every English\nsentence. To some depree, there is compression in every\nsingle word we utter, just because each word carries the\nwhisper of the meanings of the words it is connected to.\nEven “Please pass the butter, Fred” has some compres-\nsion in it, because it carries overtones that lie in the con-\nnections of these words to all the words which came be-\nfore it.\nFach of us, talking to our friends, or to our families,\nmakes use of these compressions, which are drawn out\nfrom the connections between words which are given by\nthe language. The more we can feel all the connections\nin the language, the more rich and subtle are the things\nwe say at the most ordinary times.\nAnd once again, the same is true in building. The com-\npression of patterns into a single space, is not a poetic\nand exotic thing, kept for special buildings which are\nworks of art. It is the most ordinary economy of space. It\nis quite possible that all the patterns for a house might,\nin some form be present, and overlapping, in a simple\none-room cabin, The patterns do not need to be strung\nout, and kept separate. Every building, every room,\nxd\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nevery garden is better, when all the patterns which it\nneeds are compressed as far as it is possible for them to\nbe. The building will be cheaper; and the meanings in it\nwill be denser.\nIt is essential then, once you have learned to use the\nlanguage, that you pay attention to the possibility of\ncompressing the many patterns which you put together,\nin the smallest possible space. You may think of this\nprocess of compressing patterns, as a way to make the\ncheapest possible building which has the necessary pat-\nterns in it. It is, also, the only way of using a pattern\nlanguage to make buildings which are poems.\n","summary":"This chunk discusses the concept of an \"eccentric nucleus\" within a community, which is a pattern for how density should vary locally within a community. It is part of a larger section on establishing the overall structure and layout of a town or community.","chunk":"# 28 Eccentric Nucleus*\n\n. . , so far, we have established an overall height restriction on the city, with its attendant limitation on average density-FOUR- STORY LIMIT (21). If we assume, also, that the city contains major centers for every 300,000 people, spaced according to the rules in MAGIC OF THE CITY (10), it will then follow that the overall density of the city slopes off from these centers: the highest density near to them, the lowest far away. This means that any individual community or 7000 (12) will have an overall density, given by its distance from the nearest downtown. The question then arises: How should density vary locally, within this community; what geometric pattern should the density have? The question is complicated greatly by the principle of sUBCUL- TURE BOUNDARY (13), which requires that communities are surrounded by their services, instead of having their services at their geometric centers. This pattern, and the next, defines a local distribution of density which is compatible with this context.\n\n## 中 中 中\n\nThe random character of local densities confuses the identity of our communities, and also creates a chaos in the pattern of land use.\n\nLet us begin by considering the typical configuration of the residential densities in a town. There is an overall slope to the densities: they are high toward the center and lower toward the outskirts. But there is no recognizable structure within this overall slope: no clearly visible repeating pattern we can see again and again within the city. Compare this with the contours of a mountain range. In a mountain range, there is a great deal of recognizable structure; we see systematic ridges and valleys, foothills, bowls, and peaks which have arisen naturally from geological. processes; and all this structure is repeated again and again, from . place to place, within the whole.","embeddings":[null]},{"document":"A PATTERN LANGUAGE\nVolume 1, The Timeless Way of Building, and Volume\n2, 4 Patrern Language, are two halves of a single work.\nThis book provides a language, for building and plan-\nning; the other book provides the theory and instruc-\ntions for the use of the language. This book. describes the\ndetailed patterns for towns and neighborhoods, houses,\ngardens, and rooms. The other book explains the disci-\npline which makes it possible to use these patterns to\ncreate a building or a town. This book is the sourcebook of\nthe timeless way; the other is its practice and its origin.\nThe two books have evolved very much in parallel.\nThey have been growing over the last eight years, as\nwe have worked on the one hand to understand the\nnature of the building process, and on the other hand to\nconstruct an actual, possible pattern language. We have\nbeen forced by practical considerations, to publish these\ntwo books under separate covers; but in fact, they form\nan indivisible whole. It is possible to read them sepa-\nrately. But to gain the insight which we have tried to\ncommunicate in them, it is essential that you read them\nboth.\nThe Timeless Way of Building describes the funda-\nmental nature of the task of making towns and buildings.\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nIt is shown there, that towns and buildings will not be\nable to become alive, unless they are made by all the\npeople in society, and unless these people share a com-\nmon pattern language, within which to make these\nbuildings, and unless this cornmon pattern language is\nalive itself.\nTn this book, we present one possible pattern language,\nof the kind called for in The Timeless Way. This lan-\nguage is extremely practical. It is a language that we\nhave distilled from our own building and planning ef-\nforts over the last eight years. You can use it to work\nwith your neighbors, to improve your town and neighbor-\nhood. You can use it to design a house for yourself,\nwith your family; or to work with other people to de-\nsign an office or a workshop or a public building like a\nschool. And you can use it to guide you in the actual\nprocess of construction.\nThe elements of this language are entities called pat-\nterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs\nover and over again in our environment, and then\ndescribes the core of the solution to that problem, in such\na way that you can use this solution a million times over,\nwithout ever doing it the same way twice.\nFor convenience and clarity, each pattern has the same\nformat. First, there is a picture, which shows an arche-\ntypal example of that pattern. Second, after the picture,\neach pattern has an introductory paragraph, which sets\nthe context for the pattern, by explaining how it helps\nto complete certain larger patterns. Then there are three\ndiamonds to mark the beginning of the problem. After\nthe diamonds there is a headline, in bold type. This\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nheadline gives the essence of the problem in one or two\nsentences. After the headline comes the body of the\nproblem. This is the longest section. It describes the\nempirical background of the pattern, the evidence for its\nvalidity, the range of different ways the pattern can be\nmanifested in a building, and so on. Then, again in\nbold type, like the headline, is the solution—the heart\nof the pattern—which describes the field of physical and\nsocial relationships which are required to solve the stated\nproblem, in the stated context. This solution is always\nexactly what you need to do, to build the pattern. Then,\nafter the solution, there is a diagram, which shows the\nsolution in the form of a diagram, with labels to indicate\nits main components.\nAfter the diagram, another three diamonds, to show\nthat the main body of the pattern is finished. And finally,\nafter the diamonds there is a paragraph which ties the\npattern to all those smaller patterns in the language,\nwhich are needed to complete this pattern, to embellish\nit, to All it out.\nThere are two essential purposes behind this format.\nFirst, to present each pattern connected to other patterns,\nso that you grasp the collection of all 253 patterns as a\nwhole, as a language, within which you can create an in-\nfinite variety of combinations. Second, to present the\nproblem and solution of each pattern in such a way that\nyou can judge it for yourself, and modify it, without\nlosing the essence that is central to it.\nLet us next understand the nature of the connection\nbetween patterns.\nXI\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nThe patterns are ordered, beginning with the very\nlargest, for regions and towns, then working down\nthrough neighborhoods, clusters of buildings, buildings,\nrooms and alcoves, ending finally with details of con-\nstruction.\nThis order, which is presented as a straight linear\nsequerice, is essential to the way the language works. It is\npresented, and explained more fully, in the next section.\nWhat is most important about this sequence, is that it is\nbased on the connections between the patterns. Each\npattern is connected to certain “larger” patterns which\ncome above it in the language; and to certain “smaller”\npatterns which come below it in the language. The pat-\ntern helps to complete those larger patterns which are\n“above” it, and is itself completed by those smaller pat-\nterns which are “below” it.\nThus, for example, you will find that the pattern ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN (60), is connected first to certain larger\npatterns: SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY (13), IDENTIFIABLE\nNEIGHBORHOOD (14), WORK COMMUNITY (41), and\nquirr Backs (59). These appear on its first page. And it\nis also connected to certain smaller patterns: PosiTIVE\nOUTDOOR SPACE (107), TREE PLACES (171), and GARDEN\nWALL (173). These appear on its last page.\nWhat this means, is that IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBOR-\nHOOD, SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, WORK COMMUNITY, and\nQUIET BACKS are incomplete, unless they contain an ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN; and that an ACCESSIBLE GREEN is itself\nincomplete, unless it contains POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nAnd what it means in practical terms is that, if you\nx\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to lay out a green according to this pattern, you\nmust not only follow the instructions which describe the\npattern itself, but must also try to embed the green\nWithin an IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD or in some sUB-\nCULTURE BOUNDARY, and in a way that helps to form\nquizr Backs; and then you must work to complete the\ngreen by building in some posiTIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nIn short, no pattern is an isolated entity. Each pattern\ncan exist in the world, only to the extent that is sup-\nported by other patterns: the larger patterns in which it\nis embedded, the patterns of the same size that surround\nit, and the smaller patterns which are embedded in it.\nThis is a fundamental view of the world, It says that\nwhen you build a thing you cannot merely build that\nthing in isolation, but must also repair the world around\nit, and within it, so that the larger world at that one\nplace becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the\nthing which you make takes its place in the web of na-\nture, as you make it.\nNow we explain the nature of the relation between\nproblems and solutions, within the individual patterns.\nEach solution is stated in such a way that it gives the\nessential field of relationships needed to solve the prob-\nlem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you\ncan solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by\nadapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions\nat the place where you are making it.\nFor this reason, we have tried to write each solution\nin a way which imposes nothing on you. It contains only\nthose essentials which cannot be avoided if you really\nXU\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to solve the problem. In this sense, we have tried,\nin each solution, to capture the invariant property com-\nmon to all places which succeed in solving the problem.\nBut of course, we have not always succeeded. The\nsolutions we have given to these problems vary in signif-\ncance, Some are more true, more profound, more cer-\ntain, than others. To show this clearly we have marked\nevery pattern, in the text itself, with two asterisks, or one\nasterisk, or no asterisks.\nIn the patterns marked with two asterisks, we believe\nthat we have succeeded in stating a true invariant: in\nshort, that the solution we have stated summarizes a\nproperty common to all possible ways of solving the\nstated problem. In these two-asterisk cases we believe,\nin short, that it is not possible to solve the stated prob-\nlem properly, without shaping the environment in one\nway or another according to the pattern that we have\ngiven—and that, in these cases, the pattern describes\na deep and inescapable property of a well-formed en-\nvironment.\nIn the patterns marked with one asterisk, we believe\nthat we have made some progress towards identifying\nsuch an invariant: but that with careful work it will\ncertainly be possible to improve on the solution, In\nthese cases, we believe it would be wise for you to treat\nthe pattern with a certain amount of disrespect—and\nthat you seek out variants of the solution which we have\ngiven, since there are almost certainly possible ranges of\nsolutions which are not covered by what we have written.\nFinally, in the patterns without an asterisk, we are\ncertain that we have mot succeeded in defining a true\nx1V\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\ninvariant—that, on the contrary, there are certainly ways\nof solving the problem different from the one which we\nhave given. In these cases we have still stated a solution,\nin order to be concrete—to provide the reader with at\nleast one way of solving the problem-—but the task of\nfinding the true invariant, the true property which hes\nat the heart of all possible solutions to this problem, re-\nmains undone.\nWe hope, of course, that many of the people who\nread, and use this language, will try to improve these\npatterns—will put their energy to work, in this task of\nfinding more true, more profound invariants—and we\nhope that gradually these more true patterns, which are\nslowly discovered, as time goes on, will enter a common\nlanguage, which all of us can share.\nYou see then that the patterns are very much alive\nand evolving. In fact, if you like, each pattern may be\nlooked upon as a hypothesis like one of the hypotheses of\nscience. In this sense, each pattern represents our current\nbest guess as to what arrangement of the physical envi-\nronment will work to solve the problem presented. The\nempirical questions center on the problem—does it occur\nand is it felt in the way we have described it?—-and the\nsolution—-does the arrangement we propose in fact re-\nsolve the problem? And the asterisks represent our\ndegree of faith in these hypotheses. But of course, no\nmatter what the asterisks say, the patterns are still\nhypotheses, all 253 of them-—-and are therefore all\ntentative, all free to evolve under the impact of new\nexperience and observation.\nLet us finally explain the status of this language, why\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwe have called it “A Pattern Language” with the em-\nphasis on the word “A,” and how we imagine this pat-\ntern language might be related to the countless thou-\nsands of other languages we hope that people will make\nfor themselves, in the future.\nThe Timeless Way of Building says that every society\nwhich is alive and whole, will have its own unique and\ndistinct pattern language; and further, that every in-\ndividual in such a society will have a unique language,\nshared in part, but which as a totality is unique to the\nraind of the person who has it. In this sense, in a healthy\nsociety there will be as many pattern languages as there\nare people—even though these languages are shared and\nsimular,\nThe question then arises: What exactly is the status\nof this published language? In what frame of mind, and\nwith what intention, are we publishing this language\nhere? The fact that it is published as a book means that\nmany thousands of people can use it. Is it not true that\nthere is a danger that people might come to rely on this\none printed language, instead of developing their own\nlanguages, in their own minds?\nThe fact is, that we have written this book as a first\nstep in the society-wide process by which people will\ngradually become conscious of their own pattern lan-\nguages, and work to improve them. We believe, and\nhave explained in The Timeless Way of Building, that\nthe languages which people have today are so brutal, and\nso fragmented, that most people no longer have any\nlanguage to speak of at all—and what they do have is\nnot based on human, or natural considerations.\nXVI\n& PATTERN LANGUAGE\nWe have spent years trying to formulate this lan-\nguage, in the hope that when a person uses tt, he will\nbe so impressed by its power, and so joyful in its use,\nthat he will understand again, what it means to have a\nliving language of this kind. [If we only succeed in that,\nit is possible that each person may once again embark on\nthe construction and development of his own language—\nperhaps taking the language printed in this book, as a\npoint of departure.\nAnd yet, we do believe, of course, that this language\nwhich is printed here is something more than a manual,\nor a teacher, or a version of a possible pattern language.\nMany of the patterns here are archetypal—so deep, so\ndeeply rooted in the nature of things, that it seems likely\nthat they will be a part of human nature, and human ac-\ntion, as much in five hundred years, as they are today.\nWe doubt very much whether anyone could construct\na valid pattern language, in his own mind, which did\nnot include the pattern arcapes (119) for example, or\nthe pattern aLcoves (179).\nIn this sense, we have also tried to penetrate, as deep\nas we are able, into the nature of things in the environ-\nment: and hope that a great part of this language, which\nwe print here, will be a core of any sensible human pat-\ntern language, which any person constructs for himself,\nin his own mind. In this sense, at least a part of the\nlanguage we have presented here, is the archetypal core\nof all possible pattern languages, which can make people\nfeel alive and human.\nXVII\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nA pattern language has the structure of a network. This\nis explained fully in The Timeless Way of Bualdimg.\nHowever, when we use the network of a language, we\nalways use it as a sequence, going through the patterns,\nmoving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,\nalways from the ones which create structures, to the ones\nwhich then embellish those structures, and then to those\nwhich embellish the embellishments. . . .\nSince the language is in truth a network, there is no\none sequence which perfectly captures it. But the se-\nquence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the\nfull network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down,\ndips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little\nlike a needle following a tapestry.\nThe sequence of patterns is both a summary of the\nlanguage, and at the same time, an index to the patterns.\nIf you read through the sentences which connect the\ngroups of patterns to one another, you will get an over-\nview of the whole language. And once you get this over-\nview, you will then be able to find the patterns which\nare relevant to your own project.\nAnd finally, as we shall explain in the next section,\nthis sequence of patterns is also the “base map,” from\nKVL\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nwhich you can make a language for your own project,\nby choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,\nand leaving them more or less in the order that you\nfind them printed here.\nWe begin with that part of the language which defines\na town or community. These patterns can never be “de-\nsigned” or “buil?” in one fell swoop—but patient piece-\nmeal growth, designed in such a way that every indi-\nvidual act is always helping to create or generate these\nlarger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the\nyears, make a community that has these global patterns\nin tk.\nI.

They create\na coherent picture of an entire region, with the power\nto generate such regions in a million forms, with in-\nfinite variety in all the details.\nIt 1s also true that any small sequence of patterns from\nthis language is itself a language for a smaller part of\nthe environment; and this small list of patterns is then\ncapable of generating a million parks, paths, houses,\nworkshops, or gardens.\nFor example, consider the following ten patterns:\nPRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET (140)\nSUNNY PLACE (161)\nOUTDOOR ROOM (163)\nSIX-FOOT BALCONY (167)\nPATHS AND GOALS (120)\nCEILING HEIGHT VARIETY (190)\nCOLUMNS AT THE CORNERS (212)\nFRONT DOOR BENCH (242)\nRAISED FLOWERS (245)\nDIFFERENT CHAIRS (251)\nThis short list of patterns is itself a language: it is one\nof a thousand possible languages for a porch, at the front\nof a house, One of us chose this small language, to build\nAXERV\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBYJECT\na porch onto the front of his house. This is the way the\nlanguage, and its patterns, helped to generate this porch.\nI started with PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE sTREET (140). That\npattern calls for a terrace, slightly raised, connected to the house,\nand on the street side. suNNY PLACE (161) suggests that a special\nplace on the sunny side of the yard should be intensified and\nmade into a place by the use of a patio, balcony, outdoor room,\netc, | used these two patterns to locate a raised platform on the\nsouth side of the house.\nit half under the existing roof overhang, and kept a mature\npyracanthus tree right smack in the middle of the platform. The\noverhead foliage of the tree added to the roof-like enclosure of\nthe space. I put a wind screen of fixed glass on the west side of\nthe platform too, to give it even more enclosure.\nplatform. But this pattern had to be used judiciously and not\nblindly—the reasoning for the pattern has to do with the mini-\nmum space required for people to sit comfortably and carry on a\ndiscussion around a small side-table. Since 1 wanted space for at\nleast two of these conversation areas—one under the roof for very\nfeet square.\nNow PATHS AND Goats (120): Usually, this pattern deals with\nlarge paths in a neighborhood, and comes much earlier in a lan-\nguage. But I used it in a special way. It says that the paths which\nnaturally get formed by people’s walking, on the land, should be\npreserved and intensified. Since the path to our front door cut\nright across the corner of the place where 1 had planned to put\nthe platform, 1 cut the corner of the platform aff.\nThe height of the platform above the ground was determined\nby CEILING HEIGHT varieETY (190). By building the platform\napproximately one foot above the ground line, the ceiling height\nof the covered portion came out at between 6 and 7 feet——just\nright for a space as small as this. Since this height above the\nBOOR BENCH (242) was automatically satisfied.\nThere were three columns standing, supporting the roof over\nXXXVI]ground level is just about right for sitting, the pattern FRONT\nhot or rainy days, and one out under the sky for days when you\nwanted to be full in the sun, the balcony had to be made 12 x 12\nI used six-Foor BaLcony (167) to determine the size of the\nTo make this platform into an ovTsoor Room (163), I put\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nthe old porch, They had to stay where they are, because they hold\nthe roof up. But, following covumns ar THE coRNERs (212),\nthe platform was very carefully tailored to their positions—so that\nthe columns help define the social spaces on either side of them.\nFinally, we put a couple of flower boxes next to the “front door\nbench”—it’s nice to smell them when you sit there—according to\nRAISED FLowERs (245). And the old chairs you can see in the\nporch are DIeFERENT CHAIRS (251).\nYou can see, from this short example, how powerful\nand simple a pattern language is, And you are now,\nperhaps ready to appreciate how careful you must be,\nwhen you construct a language for yourself and your\nown project.\nThe character of the porch is given by the ten patterns\nin this short language. In just this way, each part of the\nenvironment is given its character by the collection of\npatterns which we choose to build into it. The character\nof what you build, will be given to it by the language of\npatterns you use, to generate it.\nXxxvii\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nFor this reason, of course, the task of choosing a lan-\nguage for your project is fundamental. The pattern lan-\nguage we have given here contains 253 patterns. You\ncan therefore use it to generate an almost unimaginably\nlarge number of possible different smaller languages,\nfor all the different projects you may choose to do,\nsimply by picking patterns from it.\nWe shall now describe a rough procedure by which\nyou can choose a language for your own project, first by\ntaking patterns from this language we have printed here,\nand then by adding patterns of your own.\nr. First of all, make a copy of the master sequence\n(pages xix-xxxiv) on which you can tick off the patterns\nwhich will form the language for your project. If you\ndon’t have access to a copying machine, you can tick off\npatterns in the list printed in the book, use paper clips\nto mark pages, write your own list, use paper markers—\nwhatever you like. But just for now, to explain it clearly,\nwe shall assume that you have a copy of the list in front\nof you.\n2. Scan down the list, and find the pattern which\nbest describes the overall scope of the project you have\nin mind, This is the starting pattern for your project.\nTick it. CIE there are two or three possible candidates,\ndon’t worry: just pick the one which seems best: the\nothers will fall in place as you move forward.)\n3. Turn to the starting pattern itself, in the book, and\nread it through. Notice that the other patterns men-\ntioned by name at the beginning and at the end, of the\npattern you are reading, are also possible candidates for\nyour language. The ones at the beginning will tend to be\n“larger” than your project. Don’t include them, unless\nXXXVI\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nyou have the power to help create these patterns, at least\nin a small way, in the world around your project. The\nones at the end are “smaller.” Almost all of them will\nbe important. Tick all of them, on your list, unless you\nhave some special reason for not wanting to include\nthem.\n4. Now your list has some more ticks on it. Turn to\nthe next highest pattern on the list which is ticked, and\nopen the book to that pattern. Once again, it will lead\nyou to other patterns. Once again, tick those which are\nrelevant—especially the ones which are “smaller” that\ncome at the end. As a general rule, do not tick the ones\nwhich are “larger” unless you can do something about\nthem, concretely, in your own project.\n5. When in doubt about a pattern, don’t include it.\nYour list can easily get too long: and if it does, it will\nbecome confusing. The list will be quite long enough,\neven if you only include the patterns you especially like.\n6. Keep going like this, until you have ticked all the\npatterns you want for your project.\n7. Now, adjust the sequence by adding your own ma-\nterial. If there are things you want to include in your\nproject, but you have not been able to find patterns which\ncorrespond to them, then write them in, at an appropri-\nate point in the sequence, near other patterns which are\nof about the same size and importance. For example,\nthere is no pattern for a sauna. If you want to include\none, write it in somewhere near BATHING ROOM (144)\nin your sequence.\n8. And of course, if you want to change any patterns,\nchange them. There are often cases where you may have\na personal version of a pattern, which is more true, or\nXXXIN\nCHOCSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nmore relevant for you. In this case, you will get the most\n“power” over the language, and make it your own most\neffectively, if you write the changes in, at the appropri-\nate places in the book. And, it will be most concrete of\nall, if you change the name of the pattern too—so that\nit captures your own changes clearly.\nyp oe\nSuppose now that you have a language for your proj-\nect. The way to use the language depends very much\non its scale. Patterns dealing with towns can only be\nimplemented gradually, by grass roots action; patterns\nfor a building can be built up in your mind, and marked\nout on the ground; patterns for construction must be\nbuilt physically, on the site. For this reason we have\ngiven three separate instructions, for these three different\nscales. For towns, see page 3; for buildings, see page\n463; for construction, see page 935.\nThe procedures for each of these three scales are de-\nscribed in much more detail with extensive examples,\nin the appropriate chapters of The Timeless Way of\nBuilding. For the town—see chapters 24 and 25; for an\nindividual building—see chapters 20, 21, and 22; and for\nthe process of construction which describes the way a\nbuilding is actually built see chapter 23.\nxh\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nFinally, a note of caution. This language, lke English,\ncan be a medium for prose, or a medium for poetry. The\ndifference between prose and poetry is not that different\nJanpuages are used, but that the same language is used,\ndifferently. In an ordinary English sentence, each word\nhas one meaning, and the sentence too, has one simple\nmeaning. In a poem, the meaning is far more dense.\nEach word carries several meanings; and the sentence\nas a Whole carries an enormous density of interlocking\nmeanings, which together illuminate the whole.\nThe same is true for pattern languages. It is possible\nto make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a\nrather loose way. A building made like this, is an as-\nsembly of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound.\nBut it 1s also possible to put patterns together in such a\nway that many many patterns overlap in the same\nphysical space: the building is very dense; it has many\nmeanings captured in a small space; and through this\ndensity, it becomes profound.\nIn a poern, this kind of density, creates illumination,\nby making identities between words, and meanings,\nwhose identity we have not understood before. In “O\nRose thou art sick,” the rose is identifed with many\nxii\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\ngreater, and more personal things than any rose—and\nthe poem illuminates the person, and the rose, because of\nthis connection. The connection not only illuminates the\nwords, but also illuminates our actual lives.\n© Rose thon art sick,\n‘The invisible worm,\nThat flies in the night\nin the howling storm:\nHas found out thy bed\nOF crimson joy:\nAnd his dark secret Jove\nDoes thy life destroy,\nWILLIAM BLAKE\nThe same exactly, happens in a building, Consider, for\nexample, the two patterns BATHING ROOM (144) and\nSTILL WATER (71). One defines a part of a house where\nyou can bathe yourself slowly, with pleasure, perhaps\nin company; a place to rest your limbs, and to relax. The\nother is a place in a neighborhood, where this is water\nto gaze into, perhaps to swim in, where children can sail\nboats, and splash about, which nourishes those parts of\nourselves which rely on water as one of the great\nelements of the unconscious.\nSuppose now, that we make a complex of buildings\nwhere individual bathing rooms are somehow connected\nto a common pond, or lake, or pool—where the bathing\nroom merges with this common place; where there is no\nsharp distinction between the individual and family pro-\ncesses of the bathing room, and the common pleasure\nof the common pool. In this place, these two patterns\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nexist in the same space; they are identified, there is a\ncompression of the two, which requires less space, and\nwhich is more profound than in a place where they are\nmerely side by side. The compression illuminates each\nof the patterns, sheds light on its meaning; and also i-\nluminates our lives, as we understand a little more about\nthe connections of our inner needs.\nBut this kind of compression is not only poetic and\nprofound. It is not only the stuff of poems and exotic\nstatements, but to some degree, the stuff of every English\nsentence. To some depree, there is compression in every\nsingle word we utter, just because each word carries the\nwhisper of the meanings of the words it is connected to.\nEven “Please pass the butter, Fred” has some compres-\nsion in it, because it carries overtones that lie in the con-\nnections of these words to all the words which came be-\nfore it.\nFach of us, talking to our friends, or to our families,\nmakes use of these compressions, which are drawn out\nfrom the connections between words which are given by\nthe language. The more we can feel all the connections\nin the language, the more rich and subtle are the things\nwe say at the most ordinary times.\nAnd once again, the same is true in building. The com-\npression of patterns into a single space, is not a poetic\nand exotic thing, kept for special buildings which are\nworks of art. It is the most ordinary economy of space. It\nis quite possible that all the patterns for a house might,\nin some form be present, and overlapping, in a simple\none-room cabin, The patterns do not need to be strung\nout, and kept separate. Every building, every room,\nxd\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nevery garden is better, when all the patterns which it\nneeds are compressed as far as it is possible for them to\nbe. The building will be cheaper; and the meanings in it\nwill be denser.\nIt is essential then, once you have learned to use the\nlanguage, that you pay attention to the possibility of\ncompressing the many patterns which you put together,\nin the smallest possible space. You may think of this\nprocess of compressing patterns, as a way to make the\ncheapest possible building which has the necessary pat-\nterns in it. It is, also, the only way of using a pattern\nlanguage to make buildings which are poems.\n","summary":"This chunk discusses the concept of an \"eccentric nucleus\" or off-center community center, and how it relates to the overall pattern language for designing towns and neighborhoods. It is part of the section on establishing local centers within communities and neighborhoods.","chunk":"# 28  Eccentric Nucleus\n\nOf course, this is only an analogy. But it does raise the question: Is it natural, and all right, if density configurations in a town are so random; or would a town be better off if there was some more visible coherent structure, some kind of systematic variation in the pattern of the densities?\n\nWhat happens when the local densities in a town vary in their present rambling, incoherent fashion? The high density areas, potentially capable of supporting intense activity cannot actually do so because they are too widely spread. And the low density areas, potentially capable of supporting silence and tranquility when they are concentrated, are also too diffusely scattered. The result: the town has neither very intense activity, nor very intense quiet. Since we have many arguments which show how vital it is for a town to give people both intense activity, and also deep and satisfying quiet-sacred siTES (24), ACTIVITY NODES (30), PROMENADE (31), QUIET BACKS (59), STILL WATER (71)-it seems quite likely, then, that this randomness of density does harm to urban life.\n\nWe believe, indeed, that a town would be far better off if it did contain a coherent pattern of densities. We present a systematic account of the factors which might naturally influence the pattern of density-in the hope of showing what kind of coherent pattern might be sensible and useful. The argument has five steps.\n\nI. We may assume, reasonably, that some kind of center, formed by local services, will occur at least once in every community of 7000. This center will typically be the kind we have called a shopping street (32). In web of shopping (19) we have shown that shopping streets occur about once for every 10,000 persons.\n\n2. From the arguments presented in subculTURE BOUNDARY\n(13), we know that this center of activity, since it is a service, should occur in the boundary between subcultures, should help to form the boundary between subcultures, and should therefore be located in the area of the boundary-not inside the community, but between communities.\n\n3. We know, also, that this center must be in just that part of the boundary which is closest to the center of the larger town or city. This follows from a dramatic and little known series of results which show that catch basins of shopping centers are not\n\ncircles, as one might naïvely suppose, but half-circles, with the half-circle on that side of the center away from the central city, because people always go to that shopping center which lies toward the center of their city, never to the one which lies toward the city's periphery.\n\n![95_image_0.png](95_image_0.png)\n\nBrennan's catch basins.\nThis phenomenon was originally discovered by Brennan in his post-war studies of Wolverhampton (T. Brennan, Midland City, London: Dobson, 1948). It has, since then, been confirmed and studied by several writers, most notably Terence Lee, \"Perceived Distance as a Function of Direction in the City,\" Environment and Behavior, June 1970, 40-51. Lee has shown that the phenomenon is not only caused by the fact that people are simply more familiar with the roads and paths that lie toward the center, and use them more often, but that their very perception of distance varies with direction, and that distances along lines toward the center are seen as much shorter than distances along lines away from the center.\n\nSince we certainly want the community to correspond with the catch basin of its \"center\" it is essential, then, that the center be placed off-center-in fact, at that point in the community which lies toward the center of the larger city. This is, of course, compatible with the notion discussed already, that the center should lie in the boundary of the community.\n\n![95_image_1.png](95_image_1.png)\n\nEccentric centers.\n\n## 1 Σ 2","embeddings":[null]},{"document":"A PATTERN LANGUAGE\nVolume 1, The Timeless Way of Building, and Volume\n2, 4 Patrern Language, are two halves of a single work.\nThis book provides a language, for building and plan-\nning; the other book provides the theory and instruc-\ntions for the use of the language. This book. describes the\ndetailed patterns for towns and neighborhoods, houses,\ngardens, and rooms. The other book explains the disci-\npline which makes it possible to use these patterns to\ncreate a building or a town. This book is the sourcebook of\nthe timeless way; the other is its practice and its origin.\nThe two books have evolved very much in parallel.\nThey have been growing over the last eight years, as\nwe have worked on the one hand to understand the\nnature of the building process, and on the other hand to\nconstruct an actual, possible pattern language. We have\nbeen forced by practical considerations, to publish these\ntwo books under separate covers; but in fact, they form\nan indivisible whole. It is possible to read them sepa-\nrately. But to gain the insight which we have tried to\ncommunicate in them, it is essential that you read them\nboth.\nThe Timeless Way of Building describes the funda-\nmental nature of the task of making towns and buildings.\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nIt is shown there, that towns and buildings will not be\nable to become alive, unless they are made by all the\npeople in society, and unless these people share a com-\nmon pattern language, within which to make these\nbuildings, and unless this cornmon pattern language is\nalive itself.\nTn this book, we present one possible pattern language,\nof the kind called for in The Timeless Way. This lan-\nguage is extremely practical. It is a language that we\nhave distilled from our own building and planning ef-\nforts over the last eight years. You can use it to work\nwith your neighbors, to improve your town and neighbor-\nhood. You can use it to design a house for yourself,\nwith your family; or to work with other people to de-\nsign an office or a workshop or a public building like a\nschool. And you can use it to guide you in the actual\nprocess of construction.\nThe elements of this language are entities called pat-\nterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs\nover and over again in our environment, and then\ndescribes the core of the solution to that problem, in such\na way that you can use this solution a million times over,\nwithout ever doing it the same way twice.\nFor convenience and clarity, each pattern has the same\nformat. First, there is a picture, which shows an arche-\ntypal example of that pattern. Second, after the picture,\neach pattern has an introductory paragraph, which sets\nthe context for the pattern, by explaining how it helps\nto complete certain larger patterns. Then there are three\ndiamonds to mark the beginning of the problem. After\nthe diamonds there is a headline, in bold type. This\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nheadline gives the essence of the problem in one or two\nsentences. After the headline comes the body of the\nproblem. This is the longest section. It describes the\nempirical background of the pattern, the evidence for its\nvalidity, the range of different ways the pattern can be\nmanifested in a building, and so on. Then, again in\nbold type, like the headline, is the solution—the heart\nof the pattern—which describes the field of physical and\nsocial relationships which are required to solve the stated\nproblem, in the stated context. This solution is always\nexactly what you need to do, to build the pattern. Then,\nafter the solution, there is a diagram, which shows the\nsolution in the form of a diagram, with labels to indicate\nits main components.\nAfter the diagram, another three diamonds, to show\nthat the main body of the pattern is finished. And finally,\nafter the diamonds there is a paragraph which ties the\npattern to all those smaller patterns in the language,\nwhich are needed to complete this pattern, to embellish\nit, to All it out.\nThere are two essential purposes behind this format.\nFirst, to present each pattern connected to other patterns,\nso that you grasp the collection of all 253 patterns as a\nwhole, as a language, within which you can create an in-\nfinite variety of combinations. Second, to present the\nproblem and solution of each pattern in such a way that\nyou can judge it for yourself, and modify it, without\nlosing the essence that is central to it.\nLet us next understand the nature of the connection\nbetween patterns.\nXI\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nThe patterns are ordered, beginning with the very\nlargest, for regions and towns, then working down\nthrough neighborhoods, clusters of buildings, buildings,\nrooms and alcoves, ending finally with details of con-\nstruction.\nThis order, which is presented as a straight linear\nsequerice, is essential to the way the language works. It is\npresented, and explained more fully, in the next section.\nWhat is most important about this sequence, is that it is\nbased on the connections between the patterns. Each\npattern is connected to certain “larger” patterns which\ncome above it in the language; and to certain “smaller”\npatterns which come below it in the language. The pat-\ntern helps to complete those larger patterns which are\n“above” it, and is itself completed by those smaller pat-\nterns which are “below” it.\nThus, for example, you will find that the pattern ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN (60), is connected first to certain larger\npatterns: SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY (13), IDENTIFIABLE\nNEIGHBORHOOD (14), WORK COMMUNITY (41), and\nquirr Backs (59). These appear on its first page. And it\nis also connected to certain smaller patterns: PosiTIVE\nOUTDOOR SPACE (107), TREE PLACES (171), and GARDEN\nWALL (173). These appear on its last page.\nWhat this means, is that IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBOR-\nHOOD, SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, WORK COMMUNITY, and\nQUIET BACKS are incomplete, unless they contain an ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN; and that an ACCESSIBLE GREEN is itself\nincomplete, unless it contains POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nAnd what it means in practical terms is that, if you\nx\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to lay out a green according to this pattern, you\nmust not only follow the instructions which describe the\npattern itself, but must also try to embed the green\nWithin an IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD or in some sUB-\nCULTURE BOUNDARY, and in a way that helps to form\nquizr Backs; and then you must work to complete the\ngreen by building in some posiTIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nIn short, no pattern is an isolated entity. Each pattern\ncan exist in the world, only to the extent that is sup-\nported by other patterns: the larger patterns in which it\nis embedded, the patterns of the same size that surround\nit, and the smaller patterns which are embedded in it.\nThis is a fundamental view of the world, It says that\nwhen you build a thing you cannot merely build that\nthing in isolation, but must also repair the world around\nit, and within it, so that the larger world at that one\nplace becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the\nthing which you make takes its place in the web of na-\nture, as you make it.\nNow we explain the nature of the relation between\nproblems and solutions, within the individual patterns.\nEach solution is stated in such a way that it gives the\nessential field of relationships needed to solve the prob-\nlem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you\ncan solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by\nadapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions\nat the place where you are making it.\nFor this reason, we have tried to write each solution\nin a way which imposes nothing on you. It contains only\nthose essentials which cannot be avoided if you really\nXU\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to solve the problem. In this sense, we have tried,\nin each solution, to capture the invariant property com-\nmon to all places which succeed in solving the problem.\nBut of course, we have not always succeeded. The\nsolutions we have given to these problems vary in signif-\ncance, Some are more true, more profound, more cer-\ntain, than others. To show this clearly we have marked\nevery pattern, in the text itself, with two asterisks, or one\nasterisk, or no asterisks.\nIn the patterns marked with two asterisks, we believe\nthat we have succeeded in stating a true invariant: in\nshort, that the solution we have stated summarizes a\nproperty common to all possible ways of solving the\nstated problem. In these two-asterisk cases we believe,\nin short, that it is not possible to solve the stated prob-\nlem properly, without shaping the environment in one\nway or another according to the pattern that we have\ngiven—and that, in these cases, the pattern describes\na deep and inescapable property of a well-formed en-\nvironment.\nIn the patterns marked with one asterisk, we believe\nthat we have made some progress towards identifying\nsuch an invariant: but that with careful work it will\ncertainly be possible to improve on the solution, In\nthese cases, we believe it would be wise for you to treat\nthe pattern with a certain amount of disrespect—and\nthat you seek out variants of the solution which we have\ngiven, since there are almost certainly possible ranges of\nsolutions which are not covered by what we have written.\nFinally, in the patterns without an asterisk, we are\ncertain that we have mot succeeded in defining a true\nx1V\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\ninvariant—that, on the contrary, there are certainly ways\nof solving the problem different from the one which we\nhave given. In these cases we have still stated a solution,\nin order to be concrete—to provide the reader with at\nleast one way of solving the problem-—but the task of\nfinding the true invariant, the true property which hes\nat the heart of all possible solutions to this problem, re-\nmains undone.\nWe hope, of course, that many of the people who\nread, and use this language, will try to improve these\npatterns—will put their energy to work, in this task of\nfinding more true, more profound invariants—and we\nhope that gradually these more true patterns, which are\nslowly discovered, as time goes on, will enter a common\nlanguage, which all of us can share.\nYou see then that the patterns are very much alive\nand evolving. In fact, if you like, each pattern may be\nlooked upon as a hypothesis like one of the hypotheses of\nscience. In this sense, each pattern represents our current\nbest guess as to what arrangement of the physical envi-\nronment will work to solve the problem presented. The\nempirical questions center on the problem—does it occur\nand is it felt in the way we have described it?—-and the\nsolution—-does the arrangement we propose in fact re-\nsolve the problem? And the asterisks represent our\ndegree of faith in these hypotheses. But of course, no\nmatter what the asterisks say, the patterns are still\nhypotheses, all 253 of them-—-and are therefore all\ntentative, all free to evolve under the impact of new\nexperience and observation.\nLet us finally explain the status of this language, why\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwe have called it “A Pattern Language” with the em-\nphasis on the word “A,” and how we imagine this pat-\ntern language might be related to the countless thou-\nsands of other languages we hope that people will make\nfor themselves, in the future.\nThe Timeless Way of Building says that every society\nwhich is alive and whole, will have its own unique and\ndistinct pattern language; and further, that every in-\ndividual in such a society will have a unique language,\nshared in part, but which as a totality is unique to the\nraind of the person who has it. In this sense, in a healthy\nsociety there will be as many pattern languages as there\nare people—even though these languages are shared and\nsimular,\nThe question then arises: What exactly is the status\nof this published language? In what frame of mind, and\nwith what intention, are we publishing this language\nhere? The fact that it is published as a book means that\nmany thousands of people can use it. Is it not true that\nthere is a danger that people might come to rely on this\none printed language, instead of developing their own\nlanguages, in their own minds?\nThe fact is, that we have written this book as a first\nstep in the society-wide process by which people will\ngradually become conscious of their own pattern lan-\nguages, and work to improve them. We believe, and\nhave explained in The Timeless Way of Building, that\nthe languages which people have today are so brutal, and\nso fragmented, that most people no longer have any\nlanguage to speak of at all—and what they do have is\nnot based on human, or natural considerations.\nXVI\n& PATTERN LANGUAGE\nWe have spent years trying to formulate this lan-\nguage, in the hope that when a person uses tt, he will\nbe so impressed by its power, and so joyful in its use,\nthat he will understand again, what it means to have a\nliving language of this kind. [If we only succeed in that,\nit is possible that each person may once again embark on\nthe construction and development of his own language—\nperhaps taking the language printed in this book, as a\npoint of departure.\nAnd yet, we do believe, of course, that this language\nwhich is printed here is something more than a manual,\nor a teacher, or a version of a possible pattern language.\nMany of the patterns here are archetypal—so deep, so\ndeeply rooted in the nature of things, that it seems likely\nthat they will be a part of human nature, and human ac-\ntion, as much in five hundred years, as they are today.\nWe doubt very much whether anyone could construct\na valid pattern language, in his own mind, which did\nnot include the pattern arcapes (119) for example, or\nthe pattern aLcoves (179).\nIn this sense, we have also tried to penetrate, as deep\nas we are able, into the nature of things in the environ-\nment: and hope that a great part of this language, which\nwe print here, will be a core of any sensible human pat-\ntern language, which any person constructs for himself,\nin his own mind. In this sense, at least a part of the\nlanguage we have presented here, is the archetypal core\nof all possible pattern languages, which can make people\nfeel alive and human.\nXVII\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nA pattern language has the structure of a network. This\nis explained fully in The Timeless Way of Bualdimg.\nHowever, when we use the network of a language, we\nalways use it as a sequence, going through the patterns,\nmoving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,\nalways from the ones which create structures, to the ones\nwhich then embellish those structures, and then to those\nwhich embellish the embellishments. . . .\nSince the language is in truth a network, there is no\none sequence which perfectly captures it. But the se-\nquence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the\nfull network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down,\ndips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little\nlike a needle following a tapestry.\nThe sequence of patterns is both a summary of the\nlanguage, and at the same time, an index to the patterns.\nIf you read through the sentences which connect the\ngroups of patterns to one another, you will get an over-\nview of the whole language. And once you get this over-\nview, you will then be able to find the patterns which\nare relevant to your own project.\nAnd finally, as we shall explain in the next section,\nthis sequence of patterns is also the “base map,” from\nKVL\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nwhich you can make a language for your own project,\nby choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,\nand leaving them more or less in the order that you\nfind them printed here.\nWe begin with that part of the language which defines\na town or community. These patterns can never be “de-\nsigned” or “buil?” in one fell swoop—but patient piece-\nmeal growth, designed in such a way that every indi-\nvidual act is always helping to create or generate these\nlarger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the\nyears, make a community that has these global patterns\nin tk.\nI.

They create\na coherent picture of an entire region, with the power\nto generate such regions in a million forms, with in-\nfinite variety in all the details.\nIt 1s also true that any small sequence of patterns from\nthis language is itself a language for a smaller part of\nthe environment; and this small list of patterns is then\ncapable of generating a million parks, paths, houses,\nworkshops, or gardens.\nFor example, consider the following ten patterns:\nPRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET (140)\nSUNNY PLACE (161)\nOUTDOOR ROOM (163)\nSIX-FOOT BALCONY (167)\nPATHS AND GOALS (120)\nCEILING HEIGHT VARIETY (190)\nCOLUMNS AT THE CORNERS (212)\nFRONT DOOR BENCH (242)\nRAISED FLOWERS (245)\nDIFFERENT CHAIRS (251)\nThis short list of patterns is itself a language: it is one\nof a thousand possible languages for a porch, at the front\nof a house, One of us chose this small language, to build\nAXERV\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBYJECT\na porch onto the front of his house. This is the way the\nlanguage, and its patterns, helped to generate this porch.\nI started with PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE sTREET (140). That\npattern calls for a terrace, slightly raised, connected to the house,\nand on the street side. suNNY PLACE (161) suggests that a special\nplace on the sunny side of the yard should be intensified and\nmade into a place by the use of a patio, balcony, outdoor room,\netc, | used these two patterns to locate a raised platform on the\nsouth side of the house.\nit half under the existing roof overhang, and kept a mature\npyracanthus tree right smack in the middle of the platform. The\noverhead foliage of the tree added to the roof-like enclosure of\nthe space. I put a wind screen of fixed glass on the west side of\nthe platform too, to give it even more enclosure.\nplatform. But this pattern had to be used judiciously and not\nblindly—the reasoning for the pattern has to do with the mini-\nmum space required for people to sit comfortably and carry on a\ndiscussion around a small side-table. Since 1 wanted space for at\nleast two of these conversation areas—one under the roof for very\nfeet square.\nNow PATHS AND Goats (120): Usually, this pattern deals with\nlarge paths in a neighborhood, and comes much earlier in a lan-\nguage. But I used it in a special way. It says that the paths which\nnaturally get formed by people’s walking, on the land, should be\npreserved and intensified. Since the path to our front door cut\nright across the corner of the place where 1 had planned to put\nthe platform, 1 cut the corner of the platform aff.\nThe height of the platform above the ground was determined\nby CEILING HEIGHT varieETY (190). By building the platform\napproximately one foot above the ground line, the ceiling height\nof the covered portion came out at between 6 and 7 feet——just\nright for a space as small as this. Since this height above the\nBOOR BENCH (242) was automatically satisfied.\nThere were three columns standing, supporting the roof over\nXXXVI]ground level is just about right for sitting, the pattern FRONT\nhot or rainy days, and one out under the sky for days when you\nwanted to be full in the sun, the balcony had to be made 12 x 12\nI used six-Foor BaLcony (167) to determine the size of the\nTo make this platform into an ovTsoor Room (163), I put\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nthe old porch, They had to stay where they are, because they hold\nthe roof up. But, following covumns ar THE coRNERs (212),\nthe platform was very carefully tailored to their positions—so that\nthe columns help define the social spaces on either side of them.\nFinally, we put a couple of flower boxes next to the “front door\nbench”—it’s nice to smell them when you sit there—according to\nRAISED FLowERs (245). And the old chairs you can see in the\nporch are DIeFERENT CHAIRS (251).\nYou can see, from this short example, how powerful\nand simple a pattern language is, And you are now,\nperhaps ready to appreciate how careful you must be,\nwhen you construct a language for yourself and your\nown project.\nThe character of the porch is given by the ten patterns\nin this short language. In just this way, each part of the\nenvironment is given its character by the collection of\npatterns which we choose to build into it. The character\nof what you build, will be given to it by the language of\npatterns you use, to generate it.\nXxxvii\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nFor this reason, of course, the task of choosing a lan-\nguage for your project is fundamental. The pattern lan-\nguage we have given here contains 253 patterns. You\ncan therefore use it to generate an almost unimaginably\nlarge number of possible different smaller languages,\nfor all the different projects you may choose to do,\nsimply by picking patterns from it.\nWe shall now describe a rough procedure by which\nyou can choose a language for your own project, first by\ntaking patterns from this language we have printed here,\nand then by adding patterns of your own.\nr. First of all, make a copy of the master sequence\n(pages xix-xxxiv) on which you can tick off the patterns\nwhich will form the language for your project. If you\ndon’t have access to a copying machine, you can tick off\npatterns in the list printed in the book, use paper clips\nto mark pages, write your own list, use paper markers—\nwhatever you like. But just for now, to explain it clearly,\nwe shall assume that you have a copy of the list in front\nof you.\n2. Scan down the list, and find the pattern which\nbest describes the overall scope of the project you have\nin mind, This is the starting pattern for your project.\nTick it. CIE there are two or three possible candidates,\ndon’t worry: just pick the one which seems best: the\nothers will fall in place as you move forward.)\n3. Turn to the starting pattern itself, in the book, and\nread it through. Notice that the other patterns men-\ntioned by name at the beginning and at the end, of the\npattern you are reading, are also possible candidates for\nyour language. The ones at the beginning will tend to be\n“larger” than your project. Don’t include them, unless\nXXXVI\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nyou have the power to help create these patterns, at least\nin a small way, in the world around your project. The\nones at the end are “smaller.” Almost all of them will\nbe important. Tick all of them, on your list, unless you\nhave some special reason for not wanting to include\nthem.\n4. Now your list has some more ticks on it. Turn to\nthe next highest pattern on the list which is ticked, and\nopen the book to that pattern. Once again, it will lead\nyou to other patterns. Once again, tick those which are\nrelevant—especially the ones which are “smaller” that\ncome at the end. As a general rule, do not tick the ones\nwhich are “larger” unless you can do something about\nthem, concretely, in your own project.\n5. When in doubt about a pattern, don’t include it.\nYour list can easily get too long: and if it does, it will\nbecome confusing. The list will be quite long enough,\neven if you only include the patterns you especially like.\n6. Keep going like this, until you have ticked all the\npatterns you want for your project.\n7. Now, adjust the sequence by adding your own ma-\nterial. If there are things you want to include in your\nproject, but you have not been able to find patterns which\ncorrespond to them, then write them in, at an appropri-\nate point in the sequence, near other patterns which are\nof about the same size and importance. For example,\nthere is no pattern for a sauna. If you want to include\none, write it in somewhere near BATHING ROOM (144)\nin your sequence.\n8. And of course, if you want to change any patterns,\nchange them. There are often cases where you may have\na personal version of a pattern, which is more true, or\nXXXIN\nCHOCSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nmore relevant for you. In this case, you will get the most\n“power” over the language, and make it your own most\neffectively, if you write the changes in, at the appropri-\nate places in the book. And, it will be most concrete of\nall, if you change the name of the pattern too—so that\nit captures your own changes clearly.\nyp oe\nSuppose now that you have a language for your proj-\nect. The way to use the language depends very much\non its scale. Patterns dealing with towns can only be\nimplemented gradually, by grass roots action; patterns\nfor a building can be built up in your mind, and marked\nout on the ground; patterns for construction must be\nbuilt physically, on the site. For this reason we have\ngiven three separate instructions, for these three different\nscales. For towns, see page 3; for buildings, see page\n463; for construction, see page 935.\nThe procedures for each of these three scales are de-\nscribed in much more detail with extensive examples,\nin the appropriate chapters of The Timeless Way of\nBuilding. For the town—see chapters 24 and 25; for an\nindividual building—see chapters 20, 21, and 22; and for\nthe process of construction which describes the way a\nbuilding is actually built see chapter 23.\nxh\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nFinally, a note of caution. This language, lke English,\ncan be a medium for prose, or a medium for poetry. The\ndifference between prose and poetry is not that different\nJanpuages are used, but that the same language is used,\ndifferently. In an ordinary English sentence, each word\nhas one meaning, and the sentence too, has one simple\nmeaning. In a poem, the meaning is far more dense.\nEach word carries several meanings; and the sentence\nas a Whole carries an enormous density of interlocking\nmeanings, which together illuminate the whole.\nThe same is true for pattern languages. It is possible\nto make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a\nrather loose way. A building made like this, is an as-\nsembly of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound.\nBut it 1s also possible to put patterns together in such a\nway that many many patterns overlap in the same\nphysical space: the building is very dense; it has many\nmeanings captured in a small space; and through this\ndensity, it becomes profound.\nIn a poern, this kind of density, creates illumination,\nby making identities between words, and meanings,\nwhose identity we have not understood before. In “O\nRose thou art sick,” the rose is identifed with many\nxii\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\ngreater, and more personal things than any rose—and\nthe poem illuminates the person, and the rose, because of\nthis connection. The connection not only illuminates the\nwords, but also illuminates our actual lives.\n© Rose thon art sick,\n‘The invisible worm,\nThat flies in the night\nin the howling storm:\nHas found out thy bed\nOF crimson joy:\nAnd his dark secret Jove\nDoes thy life destroy,\nWILLIAM BLAKE\nThe same exactly, happens in a building, Consider, for\nexample, the two patterns BATHING ROOM (144) and\nSTILL WATER (71). One defines a part of a house where\nyou can bathe yourself slowly, with pleasure, perhaps\nin company; a place to rest your limbs, and to relax. The\nother is a place in a neighborhood, where this is water\nto gaze into, perhaps to swim in, where children can sail\nboats, and splash about, which nourishes those parts of\nourselves which rely on water as one of the great\nelements of the unconscious.\nSuppose now, that we make a complex of buildings\nwhere individual bathing rooms are somehow connected\nto a common pond, or lake, or pool—where the bathing\nroom merges with this common place; where there is no\nsharp distinction between the individual and family pro-\ncesses of the bathing room, and the common pleasure\nof the common pool. In this place, these two patterns\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nexist in the same space; they are identified, there is a\ncompression of the two, which requires less space, and\nwhich is more profound than in a place where they are\nmerely side by side. The compression illuminates each\nof the patterns, sheds light on its meaning; and also i-\nluminates our lives, as we understand a little more about\nthe connections of our inner needs.\nBut this kind of compression is not only poetic and\nprofound. It is not only the stuff of poems and exotic\nstatements, but to some degree, the stuff of every English\nsentence. To some depree, there is compression in every\nsingle word we utter, just because each word carries the\nwhisper of the meanings of the words it is connected to.\nEven “Please pass the butter, Fred” has some compres-\nsion in it, because it carries overtones that lie in the con-\nnections of these words to all the words which came be-\nfore it.\nFach of us, talking to our friends, or to our families,\nmakes use of these compressions, which are drawn out\nfrom the connections between words which are given by\nthe language. The more we can feel all the connections\nin the language, the more rich and subtle are the things\nwe say at the most ordinary times.\nAnd once again, the same is true in building. The com-\npression of patterns into a single space, is not a poetic\nand exotic thing, kept for special buildings which are\nworks of art. It is the most ordinary economy of space. It\nis quite possible that all the patterns for a house might,\nin some form be present, and overlapping, in a simple\none-room cabin, The patterns do not need to be strung\nout, and kept separate. Every building, every room,\nxd\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nevery garden is better, when all the patterns which it\nneeds are compressed as far as it is possible for them to\nbe. The building will be cheaper; and the meanings in it\nwill be denser.\nIt is essential then, once you have learned to use the\nlanguage, that you pay attention to the possibility of\ncompressing the many patterns which you put together,\nin the smallest possible space. You may think of this\nprocess of compressing patterns, as a way to make the\ncheapest possible building which has the necessary pat-\nterns in it. It is, also, the only way of using a pattern\nlanguage to make buildings which are poems.\n","summary":"This chunk on mini-buses is part of the larger pattern language for designing towns and communities. It falls under the section on establishing community and neighborhood policies to control the local environment, specifically the pattern on local transport areas and the web of public transportation.","chunk":"# 20 Mini-Buses*\n\n. . . this pattern helps complete the LOCAL TRANSPORT AREAS (11) and the WEB OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION (16). The local transport areas rely heavily on foot traffic, and on bikes and carts and horses. The web of public transportation relies on trains and planes and buses. Both of these patterns need a more flexible kind of public transportation to support them.\n\nPublic transportation must be able to take people from any point to any other point within the metropolitan area.\n\nBuses and trains, which run along lines, are too far from most origins and destinations to be useful. Taxis, which can go from point to point, are too expensive.\n\nTo solve the problem, it is necessary to have a kind of vehicle which is half way between the two-half like a bus, half like a taxi-a small bus which can pick up people at any point and take them to any other point, but which may also pick up other passengers on the way, to make the trip less costly than a taxi fare.\n\nRecent research, and full-scale experiments, have shown that a system of mini-buses, on call by telephone, can function in this fashion, taking people from door to door in 15 minutes, for no more than 50 cents a ride (1974): and that the system is efficient enough to support itself. It works just like a taxi, except that it picks up and drops off other passengers while you are riding; it goes to the nearest corner to save time-not to your own front door ; and it costs a quarter of an average taxi fare.\n\nThe system hinges, to a certain extent, on the development of sophisticated new computer programs. As calls come in, the computer examines the present movements of all the various minibuses, each with its particular load of passengers, and decides which bus can best afford to pick up the new passenger, with the least detour. Two-way radio contact keeps the mini-buses in communication with the dispatcher at the computer switchboard. All this, and other details, are discussed fully in a review of current\n\n## Iio\n\n![54_image_0.png](54_image_0.png)\n\nCanadian mini-bus.\ndial-a-bus research: Summary Report-The Dial-a-Ride Transportation System, M.I.T. Urban Systems Laboratory, Report\n\\# USL-TR-70-10, March 1971.\n\nDial systems for buses are actually coming into existence now because they are economically feasible. While conventional fixedroute public transport systems are experiencing a dangerous spiral of lower levels of service, fewer passengers, and increased public subsidies, over 30 working dial-a-bus systems are presently in successful operation throughout the world. For example, a dial-a-bus system in Regina, Saskatchewan, is the only part of the Regina Transit System which supports itself (Regina Telebus Study:\nOperations Report, and Financial Report, W. G. Atkinson et al.,\nJune 1972). In Batavia, New York, dial-a-bus is the sole means of public transport, serving a population of 16,000 at fares of 40 to 60 cents per ride.\n\nWe finish this pattern by reminding the reader of two vital problems of public transportation, which underline the importance of the mini-bus approach.\n\nFirst, there are very large numbers of people in cities who cannot drive; we believe the mini-bus system is the only realistic way of meeting the needs of all these people.\n\nTheir numbers are much larger than one would think. They are, in effect, a silent minority comprising the uncomplaining old and physically handicapped, the young and the poor. In 1970, over 20 percent of U.S. households did not own a car. Fifty-seven and fivetenths percent of all households with incomes under $3000 did not own a car. For households headed by persons 65 years of age or older, 44.9 percent did not own a car. Of the youths between 10 and 18 years of age, 80 percent are dependent on others, including public\ntransit, for their mobility. Among the physically disabled about 5.7 million are potential riders of public transportation if the system could take them door-to-door. (Sumner Myers, \"Turning Transit Subsidies into 'Compensatory Transportation,' \" City, Vol. 6, No. 3, Summer 1972, p. 20.)\nSecond, quite apart from these special needs, the fact is that a web of public transportation, with large buses, boats, and trains, will not work anyway, without a mini-bus system. The large systems need feeders: some way of getting to the stations. If people have to get in their cars to go to the train, then, once in the car, they stay in it and do not use the train at all. The mini-bus system is essential for the purpose of providing feeder service in the larger web of public transportation.\n\nTherefore:\nEstablish a system of small taxi-like buses, carrying up to six people each, radio-controlled, on call by telephone, able to provide point-to-point service according to the passengers' needs, and supplemented by a computer system which guarantees minimum detours, and minimum waiting times. Make bus stops for the mini-buses every 600 feet in each direction, and equip these bus stops with a phone for dialing a bus.\n\n![55_image_0.png](55_image_0.png)\n\n* * *\nPlace the bus stops mainly along major roads, as far as this can be consistent with the fact that no one ever has to walk more than 600 feet to the nearest one-PARALLEL ROADS (23); put one in every INTERCHANGE (34); and make each one a place where a few minutes' wait is pleasant-BUs STOP (92). . . .\n\n## Ii2\n\nestablish community and neighborhood policy to control the character of the local environment according to the following fundamental principles:\n21.

This book. describes the\ndetailed patterns for towns and neighborhoods, houses,\ngardens, and rooms. The other book explains the disci-\npline which makes it possible to use these patterns to\ncreate a building or a town. This book is the sourcebook of\nthe timeless way; the other is its practice and its origin.\nThe two books have evolved very much in parallel.\nThey have been growing over the last eight years, as\nwe have worked on the one hand to understand the\nnature of the building process, and on the other hand to\nconstruct an actual, possible pattern language. We have\nbeen forced by practical considerations, to publish these\ntwo books under separate covers; but in fact, they form\nan indivisible whole. It is possible to read them sepa-\nrately. But to gain the insight which we have tried to\ncommunicate in them, it is essential that you read them\nboth.\nThe Timeless Way of Building describes the funda-\nmental nature of the task of making towns and buildings.\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nIt is shown there, that towns and buildings will not be\nable to become alive, unless they are made by all the\npeople in society, and unless these people share a com-\nmon pattern language, within which to make these\nbuildings, and unless this cornmon pattern language is\nalive itself.\nTn this book, we present one possible pattern language,\nof the kind called for in The Timeless Way. This lan-\nguage is extremely practical. It is a language that we\nhave distilled from our own building and planning ef-\nforts over the last eight years. You can use it to work\nwith your neighbors, to improve your town and neighbor-\nhood. You can use it to design a house for yourself,\nwith your family; or to work with other people to de-\nsign an office or a workshop or a public building like a\nschool. And you can use it to guide you in the actual\nprocess of construction.\nThe elements of this language are entities called pat-\nterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs\nover and over again in our environment, and then\ndescribes the core of the solution to that problem, in such\na way that you can use this solution a million times over,\nwithout ever doing it the same way twice.\nFor convenience and clarity, each pattern has the same\nformat. First, there is a picture, which shows an arche-\ntypal example of that pattern. Second, after the picture,\neach pattern has an introductory paragraph, which sets\nthe context for the pattern, by explaining how it helps\nto complete certain larger patterns. Then there are three\ndiamonds to mark the beginning of the problem. After\nthe diamonds there is a headline, in bold type. This\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nheadline gives the essence of the problem in one or two\nsentences. After the headline comes the body of the\nproblem. This is the longest section. It describes the\nempirical background of the pattern, the evidence for its\nvalidity, the range of different ways the pattern can be\nmanifested in a building, and so on. Then, again in\nbold type, like the headline, is the solution—the heart\nof the pattern—which describes the field of physical and\nsocial relationships which are required to solve the stated\nproblem, in the stated context. This solution is always\nexactly what you need to do, to build the pattern. Then,\nafter the solution, there is a diagram, which shows the\nsolution in the form of a diagram, with labels to indicate\nits main components.\nAfter the diagram, another three diamonds, to show\nthat the main body of the pattern is finished. And finally,\nafter the diamonds there is a paragraph which ties the\npattern to all those smaller patterns in the language,\nwhich are needed to complete this pattern, to embellish\nit, to All it out.\nThere are two essential purposes behind this format.\nFirst, to present each pattern connected to other patterns,\nso that you grasp the collection of all 253 patterns as a\nwhole, as a language, within which you can create an in-\nfinite variety of combinations. Second, to present the\nproblem and solution of each pattern in such a way that\nyou can judge it for yourself, and modify it, without\nlosing the essence that is central to it.\nLet us next understand the nature of the connection\nbetween patterns.\nXI\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nThe patterns are ordered, beginning with the very\nlargest, for regions and towns, then working down\nthrough neighborhoods, clusters of buildings, buildings,\nrooms and alcoves, ending finally with details of con-\nstruction.\nThis order, which is presented as a straight linear\nsequerice, is essential to the way the language works. It is\npresented, and explained more fully, in the next section.\nWhat is most important about this sequence, is that it is\nbased on the connections between the patterns. Each\npattern is connected to certain “larger” patterns which\ncome above it in the language; and to certain “smaller”\npatterns which come below it in the language. The pat-\ntern helps to complete those larger patterns which are\n“above” it, and is itself completed by those smaller pat-\nterns which are “below” it.\nThus, for example, you will find that the pattern ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN (60), is connected first to certain larger\npatterns: SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY (13), IDENTIFIABLE\nNEIGHBORHOOD (14), WORK COMMUNITY (41), and\nquirr Backs (59). These appear on its first page. And it\nis also connected to certain smaller patterns: PosiTIVE\nOUTDOOR SPACE (107), TREE PLACES (171), and GARDEN\nWALL (173). These appear on its last page.\nWhat this means, is that IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBOR-\nHOOD, SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, WORK COMMUNITY, and\nQUIET BACKS are incomplete, unless they contain an ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN; and that an ACCESSIBLE GREEN is itself\nincomplete, unless it contains POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nAnd what it means in practical terms is that, if you\nx\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to lay out a green according to this pattern, you\nmust not only follow the instructions which describe the\npattern itself, but must also try to embed the green\nWithin an IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD or in some sUB-\nCULTURE BOUNDARY, and in a way that helps to form\nquizr Backs; and then you must work to complete the\ngreen by building in some posiTIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nIn short, no pattern is an isolated entity. Each pattern\ncan exist in the world, only to the extent that is sup-\nported by other patterns: the larger patterns in which it\nis embedded, the patterns of the same size that surround\nit, and the smaller patterns which are embedded in it.\nThis is a fundamental view of the world, It says that\nwhen you build a thing you cannot merely build that\nthing in isolation, but must also repair the world around\nit, and within it, so that the larger world at that one\nplace becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the\nthing which you make takes its place in the web of na-\nture, as you make it.\nNow we explain the nature of the relation between\nproblems and solutions, within the individual patterns.\nEach solution is stated in such a way that it gives the\nessential field of relationships needed to solve the prob-\nlem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you\ncan solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by\nadapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions\nat the place where you are making it.\nFor this reason, we have tried to write each solution\nin a way which imposes nothing on you. It contains only\nthose essentials which cannot be avoided if you really\nXU\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to solve the problem. In this sense, we have tried,\nin each solution, to capture the invariant property com-\nmon to all places which succeed in solving the problem.\nBut of course, we have not always succeeded. The\nsolutions we have given to these problems vary in signif-\ncance, Some are more true, more profound, more cer-\ntain, than others. To show this clearly we have marked\nevery pattern, in the text itself, with two asterisks, or one\nasterisk, or no asterisks.\nIn the patterns marked with two asterisks, we believe\nthat we have succeeded in stating a true invariant: in\nshort, that the solution we have stated summarizes a\nproperty common to all possible ways of solving the\nstated problem. In these two-asterisk cases we believe,\nin short, that it is not possible to solve the stated prob-\nlem properly, without shaping the environment in one\nway or another according to the pattern that we have\ngiven—and that, in these cases, the pattern describes\na deep and inescapable property of a well-formed en-\nvironment.\nIn the patterns marked with one asterisk, we believe\nthat we have made some progress towards identifying\nsuch an invariant: but that with careful work it will\ncertainly be possible to improve on the solution, In\nthese cases, we believe it would be wise for you to treat\nthe pattern with a certain amount of disrespect—and\nthat you seek out variants of the solution which we have\ngiven, since there are almost certainly possible ranges of\nsolutions which are not covered by what we have written.\nFinally, in the patterns without an asterisk, we are\ncertain that we have mot succeeded in defining a true\nx1V\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\ninvariant—that, on the contrary, there are certainly ways\nof solving the problem different from the one which we\nhave given. In these cases we have still stated a solution,\nin order to be concrete—to provide the reader with at\nleast one way of solving the problem-—but the task of\nfinding the true invariant, the true property which hes\nat the heart of all possible solutions to this problem, re-\nmains undone.\nWe hope, of course, that many of the people who\nread, and use this language, will try to improve these\npatterns—will put their energy to work, in this task of\nfinding more true, more profound invariants—and we\nhope that gradually these more true patterns, which are\nslowly discovered, as time goes on, will enter a common\nlanguage, which all of us can share.\nYou see then that the patterns are very much alive\nand evolving. In fact, if you like, each pattern may be\nlooked upon as a hypothesis like one of the hypotheses of\nscience. In this sense, each pattern represents our current\nbest guess as to what arrangement of the physical envi-\nronment will work to solve the problem presented. The\nempirical questions center on the problem—does it occur\nand is it felt in the way we have described it?—-and the\nsolution—-does the arrangement we propose in fact re-\nsolve the problem? And the asterisks represent our\ndegree of faith in these hypotheses. But of course, no\nmatter what the asterisks say, the patterns are still\nhypotheses, all 253 of them-—-and are therefore all\ntentative, all free to evolve under the impact of new\nexperience and observation.\nLet us finally explain the status of this language, why\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwe have called it “A Pattern Language” with the em-\nphasis on the word “A,” and how we imagine this pat-\ntern language might be related to the countless thou-\nsands of other languages we hope that people will make\nfor themselves, in the future.\nThe Timeless Way of Building says that every society\nwhich is alive and whole, will have its own unique and\ndistinct pattern language; and further, that every in-\ndividual in such a society will have a unique language,\nshared in part, but which as a totality is unique to the\nraind of the person who has it. In this sense, in a healthy\nsociety there will be as many pattern languages as there\nare people—even though these languages are shared and\nsimular,\nThe question then arises: What exactly is the status\nof this published language? In what frame of mind, and\nwith what intention, are we publishing this language\nhere? The fact that it is published as a book means that\nmany thousands of people can use it. Is it not true that\nthere is a danger that people might come to rely on this\none printed language, instead of developing their own\nlanguages, in their own minds?\nThe fact is, that we have written this book as a first\nstep in the society-wide process by which people will\ngradually become conscious of their own pattern lan-\nguages, and work to improve them. We believe, and\nhave explained in The Timeless Way of Building, that\nthe languages which people have today are so brutal, and\nso fragmented, that most people no longer have any\nlanguage to speak of at all—and what they do have is\nnot based on human, or natural considerations.\nXVI\n& PATTERN LANGUAGE\nWe have spent years trying to formulate this lan-\nguage, in the hope that when a person uses tt, he will\nbe so impressed by its power, and so joyful in its use,\nthat he will understand again, what it means to have a\nliving language of this kind. [If we only succeed in that,\nit is possible that each person may once again embark on\nthe construction and development of his own language—\nperhaps taking the language printed in this book, as a\npoint of departure.\nAnd yet, we do believe, of course, that this language\nwhich is printed here is something more than a manual,\nor a teacher, or a version of a possible pattern language.\nMany of the patterns here are archetypal—so deep, so\ndeeply rooted in the nature of things, that it seems likely\nthat they will be a part of human nature, and human ac-\ntion, as much in five hundred years, as they are today.\nWe doubt very much whether anyone could construct\na valid pattern language, in his own mind, which did\nnot include the pattern arcapes (119) for example, or\nthe pattern aLcoves (179).\nIn this sense, we have also tried to penetrate, as deep\nas we are able, into the nature of things in the environ-\nment: and hope that a great part of this language, which\nwe print here, will be a core of any sensible human pat-\ntern language, which any person constructs for himself,\nin his own mind. In this sense, at least a part of the\nlanguage we have presented here, is the archetypal core\nof all possible pattern languages, which can make people\nfeel alive and human.\nXVII\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nA pattern language has the structure of a network. This\nis explained fully in The Timeless Way of Bualdimg.\nHowever, when we use the network of a language, we\nalways use it as a sequence, going through the patterns,\nmoving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,\nalways from the ones which create structures, to the ones\nwhich then embellish those structures, and then to those\nwhich embellish the embellishments. . . .\nSince the language is in truth a network, there is no\none sequence which perfectly captures it. But the se-\nquence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the\nfull network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down,\ndips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little\nlike a needle following a tapestry.\nThe sequence of patterns is both a summary of the\nlanguage, and at the same time, an index to the patterns.\nIf you read through the sentences which connect the\ngroups of patterns to one another, you will get an over-\nview of the whole language. And once you get this over-\nview, you will then be able to find the patterns which\nare relevant to your own project.\nAnd finally, as we shall explain in the next section,\nthis sequence of patterns is also the “base map,” from\nKVL\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nwhich you can make a language for your own project,\nby choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,\nand leaving them more or less in the order that you\nfind them printed here.\nWe begin with that part of the language which defines\na town or community. These patterns can never be “de-\nsigned” or “buil?” in one fell swoop—but patient piece-\nmeal growth, designed in such a way that every indi-\nvidual act is always helping to create or generate these\nlarger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the\nyears, make a community that has these global patterns\nin tk.\nI.

They create\na coherent picture of an entire region, with the power\nto generate such regions in a million forms, with in-\nfinite variety in all the details.\nIt 1s also true that any small sequence of patterns from\nthis language is itself a language for a smaller part of\nthe environment; and this small list of patterns is then\ncapable of generating a million parks, paths, houses,\nworkshops, or gardens.\nFor example, consider the following ten patterns:\nPRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET (140)\nSUNNY PLACE (161)\nOUTDOOR ROOM (163)\nSIX-FOOT BALCONY (167)\nPATHS AND GOALS (120)\nCEILING HEIGHT VARIETY (190)\nCOLUMNS AT THE CORNERS (212)\nFRONT DOOR BENCH (242)\nRAISED FLOWERS (245)\nDIFFERENT CHAIRS (251)\nThis short list of patterns is itself a language: it is one\nof a thousand possible languages for a porch, at the front\nof a house, One of us chose this small language, to build\nAXERV\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBYJECT\na porch onto the front of his house. This is the way the\nlanguage, and its patterns, helped to generate this porch.\nI started with PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE sTREET (140). That\npattern calls for a terrace, slightly raised, connected to the house,\nand on the street side. suNNY PLACE (161) suggests that a special\nplace on the sunny side of the yard should be intensified and\nmade into a place by the use of a patio, balcony, outdoor room,\netc, | used these two patterns to locate a raised platform on the\nsouth side of the house.\nit half under the existing roof overhang, and kept a mature\npyracanthus tree right smack in the middle of the platform. The\noverhead foliage of the tree added to the roof-like enclosure of\nthe space. I put a wind screen of fixed glass on the west side of\nthe platform too, to give it even more enclosure.\nplatform. But this pattern had to be used judiciously and not\nblindly—the reasoning for the pattern has to do with the mini-\nmum space required for people to sit comfortably and carry on a\ndiscussion around a small side-table. Since 1 wanted space for at\nleast two of these conversation areas—one under the roof for very\nfeet square.\nNow PATHS AND Goats (120): Usually, this pattern deals with\nlarge paths in a neighborhood, and comes much earlier in a lan-\nguage. But I used it in a special way. It says that the paths which\nnaturally get formed by people’s walking, on the land, should be\npreserved and intensified. Since the path to our front door cut\nright across the corner of the place where 1 had planned to put\nthe platform, 1 cut the corner of the platform aff.\nThe height of the platform above the ground was determined\nby CEILING HEIGHT varieETY (190). By building the platform\napproximately one foot above the ground line, the ceiling height\nof the covered portion came out at between 6 and 7 feet——just\nright for a space as small as this. Since this height above the\nBOOR BENCH (242) was automatically satisfied.\nThere were three columns standing, supporting the roof over\nXXXVI]ground level is just about right for sitting, the pattern FRONT\nhot or rainy days, and one out under the sky for days when you\nwanted to be full in the sun, the balcony had to be made 12 x 12\nI used six-Foor BaLcony (167) to determine the size of the\nTo make this platform into an ovTsoor Room (163), I put\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nthe old porch, They had to stay where they are, because they hold\nthe roof up. But, following covumns ar THE coRNERs (212),\nthe platform was very carefully tailored to their positions—so that\nthe columns help define the social spaces on either side of them.\nFinally, we put a couple of flower boxes next to the “front door\nbench”—it’s nice to smell them when you sit there—according to\nRAISED FLowERs (245). And the old chairs you can see in the\nporch are DIeFERENT CHAIRS (251).\nYou can see, from this short example, how powerful\nand simple a pattern language is, And you are now,\nperhaps ready to appreciate how careful you must be,\nwhen you construct a language for yourself and your\nown project.\nThe character of the porch is given by the ten patterns\nin this short language. In just this way, each part of the\nenvironment is given its character by the collection of\npatterns which we choose to build into it. The character\nof what you build, will be given to it by the language of\npatterns you use, to generate it.\nXxxvii\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nFor this reason, of course, the task of choosing a lan-\nguage for your project is fundamental. The pattern lan-\nguage we have given here contains 253 patterns. You\ncan therefore use it to generate an almost unimaginably\nlarge number of possible different smaller languages,\nfor all the different projects you may choose to do,\nsimply by picking patterns from it.\nWe shall now describe a rough procedure by which\nyou can choose a language for your own project, first by\ntaking patterns from this language we have printed here,\nand then by adding patterns of your own.\nr. First of all, make a copy of the master sequence\n(pages xix-xxxiv) on which you can tick off the patterns\nwhich will form the language for your project. If you\ndon’t have access to a copying machine, you can tick off\npatterns in the list printed in the book, use paper clips\nto mark pages, write your own list, use paper markers—\nwhatever you like. But just for now, to explain it clearly,\nwe shall assume that you have a copy of the list in front\nof you.\n2. Scan down the list, and find the pattern which\nbest describes the overall scope of the project you have\nin mind, This is the starting pattern for your project.\nTick it. CIE there are two or three possible candidates,\ndon’t worry: just pick the one which seems best: the\nothers will fall in place as you move forward.)\n3. Turn to the starting pattern itself, in the book, and\nread it through. Notice that the other patterns men-\ntioned by name at the beginning and at the end, of the\npattern you are reading, are also possible candidates for\nyour language. The ones at the beginning will tend to be\n“larger” than your project. Don’t include them, unless\nXXXVI\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nyou have the power to help create these patterns, at least\nin a small way, in the world around your project. The\nones at the end are “smaller.” Almost all of them will\nbe important. Tick all of them, on your list, unless you\nhave some special reason for not wanting to include\nthem.\n4. Now your list has some more ticks on it. Turn to\nthe next highest pattern on the list which is ticked, and\nopen the book to that pattern. Once again, it will lead\nyou to other patterns. Once again, tick those which are\nrelevant—especially the ones which are “smaller” that\ncome at the end. As a general rule, do not tick the ones\nwhich are “larger” unless you can do something about\nthem, concretely, in your own project.\n5. When in doubt about a pattern, don’t include it.\nYour list can easily get too long: and if it does, it will\nbecome confusing. The list will be quite long enough,\neven if you only include the patterns you especially like.\n6. Keep going like this, until you have ticked all the\npatterns you want for your project.\n7. Now, adjust the sequence by adding your own ma-\nterial. If there are things you want to include in your\nproject, but you have not been able to find patterns which\ncorrespond to them, then write them in, at an appropri-\nate point in the sequence, near other patterns which are\nof about the same size and importance. For example,\nthere is no pattern for a sauna. If you want to include\none, write it in somewhere near BATHING ROOM (144)\nin your sequence.\n8. And of course, if you want to change any patterns,\nchange them. There are often cases where you may have\na personal version of a pattern, which is more true, or\nXXXIN\nCHOCSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nmore relevant for you. In this case, you will get the most\n“power” over the language, and make it your own most\neffectively, if you write the changes in, at the appropri-\nate places in the book. And, it will be most concrete of\nall, if you change the name of the pattern too—so that\nit captures your own changes clearly.\nyp oe\nSuppose now that you have a language for your proj-\nect. The way to use the language depends very much\non its scale. Patterns dealing with towns can only be\nimplemented gradually, by grass roots action; patterns\nfor a building can be built up in your mind, and marked\nout on the ground; patterns for construction must be\nbuilt physically, on the site. For this reason we have\ngiven three separate instructions, for these three different\nscales. For towns, see page 3; for buildings, see page\n463; for construction, see page 935.\nThe procedures for each of these three scales are de-\nscribed in much more detail with extensive examples,\nin the appropriate chapters of The Timeless Way of\nBuilding. For the town—see chapters 24 and 25; for an\nindividual building—see chapters 20, 21, and 22; and for\nthe process of construction which describes the way a\nbuilding is actually built see chapter 23.\nxh\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nFinally, a note of caution. This language, lke English,\ncan be a medium for prose, or a medium for poetry. The\ndifference between prose and poetry is not that different\nJanpuages are used, but that the same language is used,\ndifferently. In an ordinary English sentence, each word\nhas one meaning, and the sentence too, has one simple\nmeaning. In a poem, the meaning is far more dense.\nEach word carries several meanings; and the sentence\nas a Whole carries an enormous density of interlocking\nmeanings, which together illuminate the whole.\nThe same is true for pattern languages. It is possible\nto make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a\nrather loose way. A building made like this, is an as-\nsembly of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound.\nBut it 1s also possible to put patterns together in such a\nway that many many patterns overlap in the same\nphysical space: the building is very dense; it has many\nmeanings captured in a small space; and through this\ndensity, it becomes profound.\nIn a poern, this kind of density, creates illumination,\nby making identities between words, and meanings,\nwhose identity we have not understood before. In “O\nRose thou art sick,” the rose is identifed with many\nxii\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\ngreater, and more personal things than any rose—and\nthe poem illuminates the person, and the rose, because of\nthis connection. The connection not only illuminates the\nwords, but also illuminates our actual lives.\n© Rose thon art sick,\n‘The invisible worm,\nThat flies in the night\nin the howling storm:\nHas found out thy bed\nOF crimson joy:\nAnd his dark secret Jove\nDoes thy life destroy,\nWILLIAM BLAKE\nThe same exactly, happens in a building, Consider, for\nexample, the two patterns BATHING ROOM (144) and\nSTILL WATER (71). One defines a part of a house where\nyou can bathe yourself slowly, with pleasure, perhaps\nin company; a place to rest your limbs, and to relax. The\nother is a place in a neighborhood, where this is water\nto gaze into, perhaps to swim in, where children can sail\nboats, and splash about, which nourishes those parts of\nourselves which rely on water as one of the great\nelements of the unconscious.\nSuppose now, that we make a complex of buildings\nwhere individual bathing rooms are somehow connected\nto a common pond, or lake, or pool—where the bathing\nroom merges with this common place; where there is no\nsharp distinction between the individual and family pro-\ncesses of the bathing room, and the common pleasure\nof the common pool. In this place, these two patterns\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nexist in the same space; they are identified, there is a\ncompression of the two, which requires less space, and\nwhich is more profound than in a place where they are\nmerely side by side. The compression illuminates each\nof the patterns, sheds light on its meaning; and also i-\nluminates our lives, as we understand a little more about\nthe connections of our inner needs.\nBut this kind of compression is not only poetic and\nprofound. It is not only the stuff of poems and exotic\nstatements, but to some degree, the stuff of every English\nsentence. To some depree, there is compression in every\nsingle word we utter, just because each word carries the\nwhisper of the meanings of the words it is connected to.\nEven “Please pass the butter, Fred” has some compres-\nsion in it, because it carries overtones that lie in the con-\nnections of these words to all the words which came be-\nfore it.\nFach of us, talking to our friends, or to our families,\nmakes use of these compressions, which are drawn out\nfrom the connections between words which are given by\nthe language. The more we can feel all the connections\nin the language, the more rich and subtle are the things\nwe say at the most ordinary times.\nAnd once again, the same is true in building. The com-\npression of patterns into a single space, is not a poetic\nand exotic thing, kept for special buildings which are\nworks of art. It is the most ordinary economy of space. It\nis quite possible that all the patterns for a house might,\nin some form be present, and overlapping, in a simple\none-room cabin, The patterns do not need to be strung\nout, and kept separate. Every building, every room,\nxd\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nevery garden is better, when all the patterns which it\nneeds are compressed as far as it is possible for them to\nbe. The building will be cheaper; and the meanings in it\nwill be denser.\nIt is essential then, once you have learned to use the\nlanguage, that you pay attention to the possibility of\ncompressing the many patterns which you put together,\nin the smallest possible space. You may think of this\nprocess of compressing patterns, as a way to make the\ncheapest possible building which has the necessary pat-\nterns in it. It is, also, the only way of using a pattern\nlanguage to make buildings which are poems.\n","summary":"This chunk discusses the pattern \"Web of Shopping\" and how it can help locate shops and services in a way that strengthens the overall community structure described in the pattern language. It provides a detailed procedure for how to locate new shops to create a stable and evenly distributed web of shops serving the community's needs.","chunk":"# Iq Web Of Shopping*\n\n. . . this pattern defines a piecemeal process which can help to locate shops and services where they are needed, in such a way that they will strengthen the Mosaic of suBCULTURES (8),\nSUBCULTURE BOUNDARIES (13), and the decentralized economy needed for scattered work (9) and Local TRANSPORT AREAS\n(II).\n\n## 中 中 中\n\nShops rarely place themselves in those positions which best serve the people's needs, and also guarantee their own stability.\n\nLarge parts of towns have insufficient services. New shops which could provide these services often locate near the other shops and major centers, instead of locating themselves where they are needed. In an ideal town, where the shops are seen as part of the society's necessities and not merely as a way of making profit for the shopping chains, the shops would be much more widely and more homogeneously distributed than they are today.\n\nIt is also true that many small shops are unstable. Two-thirds of the small shops that people open go out of business within a year. Obviously, the community is not well served by unstable businesses, and once again, their economic instability is largely linked to mistakes of location.\n\nTo guarantee that shops are stable, as well as distributed to meet community needs, cach new shop must be placed where it will fill a gap among the other shops offering a roughly similar service and also be assured that it will get the threshold of customers which it needs in order to survive. We shall now try to express this principle in precise terms, The characteristics of a stable system of shops is rather well known. It relies, essentially, on the idea that each unit of shopping has a certain catch basin -- the population which it needs in order\n\n![48_image_0.png](48_image_0.png)\n\nto survive-and that units of any given type and size will therefore be stable if they are evenly distributed, each one at the center of a catch basin large enough to support it.\n\nCatch basiss.\nThe reason that shops and shopping centers do not always, automatically, distribute themselves according to their appropriate catch basins is easily explained by the situation known as Hotelling's problem. Imagine a beach in summer time-and, somewhere along the beach, an ice-cream seller. Suppose now, that you are also an ice-cream seller. You arrive on the beach. Where should you place yourself in relation to the first ice-cream seller? There are two possible solutions.\n\n![48_image_1.png](48_image_1.png)\n\nTwo approaches to the ice-cream problem.\nIn the first case, you essentially decide to split the beach with the other ice-cream seller. You take half the beach, and leave him half the beach. In this case, you place yourself as far away from him as you can, in a position where half the people on the beach are nearer to you than to him.\n\nIn the second case, you place yourself right next to him. You decide, in shore, to try and compete with him-and place yourself in such a way as to command the whole beach, not half of it.\n\nEvery time a shop, or shopping center opens, it faces a similar choice. It can either locate in a new area where there are no other competing businesses, or it can place itself exactly where all the other businesses are already in the hope of attracting their customers away from them.\n\nThe trouble is, very simply, that people tend to choose the second of these two alternatives, because it seems, on the surface, to be safer. In fact, however, the first of the two choices is both better and safer. It is better for the customers, who then have stores to serve them closer to their homes and work places than they do now; and it is safer for the shopkeepers themselves since-in spite of appearances-their stores are much more likely to survive when they stand, without competition, in the middle of a catch basin which needs their services.\n\nLet us now consider the global nature of a web which has this character. In present cities, shops of similar types tend to be clustered in shopping centers. They are forced to cluster, in part because of zoning ordinances, which forbid them to locate in so-called residential areas; and they are encouraged to cluster by their mistaken notion that competition with other shops will serve them better than roughly equal sharing of the available customers. In the \"peoples\" web we are proposing, shops are far more evenly spread out, with less emphasis on competition and greater emphasis on service. Of course, there will still be competition, enough to make sure that very bad shops go out of business, because cach shop will be capable of drawing customers from the nearby catch basins if it offers better service-but the accent is on cooperation instead of competition.\n\n![49_image_0.png](49_image_0.png)\n\nThe existing web.\n\nThe peoples' web.\nTo generate this kind of homogeneous people's web, it is only necesary that each new shop follow the following three-step procedure when it chooses a location :\nI. Identify all other shops which offer the service you are interested in ; locate them on the map.\n\n2. Identify and map the location of potential consumers.\n\nWherever possible, indicate the density or total number of potential consumers in any given area.\n\n3. Look for the biggest gap in the existing web of shops in those areas where there are potential consumers.\n\n![50_image_0.png](50_image_0.png)\n\nThe gap in services.\nTwo colleagues of ours have tested the efficiency and potential stability of the webs created by this procedure. (\"Computer Simulation of Market Location in an Urban Area,\" S. Angel and F. Loetterle, CES files, June 1967.) They chose to study markets. They began with a fixed area, a known population density and purchasing power, and a random distribution of markets of different sizes. They then created new markets and ikilled off old markets according to the following rules. (1)\nAmong all of the existing markets, erase any that do not capture sufficient business to support their given size; (z) among all of the possible locations for a new market, find the one which would most strongly support a new market; (3) find that size for the new market that would be most economically feasible; (4)\nfind that market among all those now existing that is the least economically feasible, and erase it from the web; (5) repeat steps (2) through (4) until no further improvement in the web can be made.\n\nUnder the impact of these rules, the random distribution of\n\nmarkets at the beginning leads gradually to a fluctuating, pulsating distribution of markets which remains economically stable throughout its changes.\n\nNow of course, even if shops of the same kind are kept apart by this procedure, shops of different kinds will tend to cluster.\n\nThis follows, simply, from the convenience of the shopper. If we follow the rules of location given above-always locating a new shop in the biggest gap in the web of similar shops-then, within that gap there are still quite a large number of different possible places to locate: and naturally, we shall try to locate near the largest cluster of other shops within that gap, to increase the number of people coming past the shop, in short, to make it more convenient for shoppers, The clusters which emerge have been thoroughly studied by Berry. It turns out that the levels of clustering are remarkably similar, even though their spacing varies greatly according to population density. (See Geography of Market Centers and Retail Distribution, B. Berry, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1967, pp. 32-33.) The clements in this web of clustering correspond closely to patterns defined in this language.\n\nTherefore:\nWhen you locate any individual shop, follow a threestep procedure:\nI. Identify all other shops which offer the service you are interested in; locate them on the map.\n\n2. Identify and map the location of potential consumers.\n\nWherever possible, indicate the density or total number of potential consumers in any given area.\n\n3. Look for the biggest gap in the existing web of shops in those areas where there are potential consumers.\n\n4. Within the gap in the web of similar shops, locate your shop next to the largest cluster of other kinds of shops.\n\n![52_image_0.png](52_image_0.png)\n\nshops of same type\nWe estimate, that under the impact of this rule, a web of shopping with the following overall characteristics will emerge:\n\n| Distance Apart             |         |         |\n|----------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Population                 | (Miles) |         |\n| MAGIC OF THE CITY (10)     | 300,000 | IO*     |\n| PROMENADES (31)            | 50,000  | 4*      |\n| SHOPPING STREETS (32)      | 10,000  | 1.8*    |\n| MARKETS OF MANY SHOPS (46) | 4,000   | I .

This book. describes the\ndetailed patterns for towns and neighborhoods, houses,\ngardens, and rooms. The other book explains the disci-\npline which makes it possible to use these patterns to\ncreate a building or a town. This book is the sourcebook of\nthe timeless way; the other is its practice and its origin.\nThe two books have evolved very much in parallel.\nThey have been growing over the last eight years, as\nwe have worked on the one hand to understand the\nnature of the building process, and on the other hand to\nconstruct an actual, possible pattern language. We have\nbeen forced by practical considerations, to publish these\ntwo books under separate covers; but in fact, they form\nan indivisible whole. It is possible to read them sepa-\nrately. But to gain the insight which we have tried to\ncommunicate in them, it is essential that you read them\nboth.\nThe Timeless Way of Building describes the funda-\nmental nature of the task of making towns and buildings.\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nIt is shown there, that towns and buildings will not be\nable to become alive, unless they are made by all the\npeople in society, and unless these people share a com-\nmon pattern language, within which to make these\nbuildings, and unless this cornmon pattern language is\nalive itself.\nTn this book, we present one possible pattern language,\nof the kind called for in The Timeless Way. This lan-\nguage is extremely practical. It is a language that we\nhave distilled from our own building and planning ef-\nforts over the last eight years. You can use it to work\nwith your neighbors, to improve your town and neighbor-\nhood. You can use it to design a house for yourself,\nwith your family; or to work with other people to de-\nsign an office or a workshop or a public building like a\nschool. And you can use it to guide you in the actual\nprocess of construction.\nThe elements of this language are entities called pat-\nterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs\nover and over again in our environment, and then\ndescribes the core of the solution to that problem, in such\na way that you can use this solution a million times over,\nwithout ever doing it the same way twice.\nFor convenience and clarity, each pattern has the same\nformat. First, there is a picture, which shows an arche-\ntypal example of that pattern. Second, after the picture,\neach pattern has an introductory paragraph, which sets\nthe context for the pattern, by explaining how it helps\nto complete certain larger patterns. Then there are three\ndiamonds to mark the beginning of the problem. After\nthe diamonds there is a headline, in bold type. This\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nheadline gives the essence of the problem in one or two\nsentences. After the headline comes the body of the\nproblem. This is the longest section. It describes the\nempirical background of the pattern, the evidence for its\nvalidity, the range of different ways the pattern can be\nmanifested in a building, and so on. Then, again in\nbold type, like the headline, is the solution—the heart\nof the pattern—which describes the field of physical and\nsocial relationships which are required to solve the stated\nproblem, in the stated context. This solution is always\nexactly what you need to do, to build the pattern. Then,\nafter the solution, there is a diagram, which shows the\nsolution in the form of a diagram, with labels to indicate\nits main components.\nAfter the diagram, another three diamonds, to show\nthat the main body of the pattern is finished. And finally,\nafter the diamonds there is a paragraph which ties the\npattern to all those smaller patterns in the language,\nwhich are needed to complete this pattern, to embellish\nit, to All it out.\nThere are two essential purposes behind this format.\nFirst, to present each pattern connected to other patterns,\nso that you grasp the collection of all 253 patterns as a\nwhole, as a language, within which you can create an in-\nfinite variety of combinations. Second, to present the\nproblem and solution of each pattern in such a way that\nyou can judge it for yourself, and modify it, without\nlosing the essence that is central to it.\nLet us next understand the nature of the connection\nbetween patterns.\nXI\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nThe patterns are ordered, beginning with the very\nlargest, for regions and towns, then working down\nthrough neighborhoods, clusters of buildings, buildings,\nrooms and alcoves, ending finally with details of con-\nstruction.\nThis order, which is presented as a straight linear\nsequerice, is essential to the way the language works. It is\npresented, and explained more fully, in the next section.\nWhat is most important about this sequence, is that it is\nbased on the connections between the patterns. Each\npattern is connected to certain “larger” patterns which\ncome above it in the language; and to certain “smaller”\npatterns which come below it in the language. The pat-\ntern helps to complete those larger patterns which are\n“above” it, and is itself completed by those smaller pat-\nterns which are “below” it.\nThus, for example, you will find that the pattern ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN (60), is connected first to certain larger\npatterns: SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY (13), IDENTIFIABLE\nNEIGHBORHOOD (14), WORK COMMUNITY (41), and\nquirr Backs (59). These appear on its first page. And it\nis also connected to certain smaller patterns: PosiTIVE\nOUTDOOR SPACE (107), TREE PLACES (171), and GARDEN\nWALL (173). These appear on its last page.\nWhat this means, is that IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBOR-\nHOOD, SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, WORK COMMUNITY, and\nQUIET BACKS are incomplete, unless they contain an ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN; and that an ACCESSIBLE GREEN is itself\nincomplete, unless it contains POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nAnd what it means in practical terms is that, if you\nx\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to lay out a green according to this pattern, you\nmust not only follow the instructions which describe the\npattern itself, but must also try to embed the green\nWithin an IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD or in some sUB-\nCULTURE BOUNDARY, and in a way that helps to form\nquizr Backs; and then you must work to complete the\ngreen by building in some posiTIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nIn short, no pattern is an isolated entity. Each pattern\ncan exist in the world, only to the extent that is sup-\nported by other patterns: the larger patterns in which it\nis embedded, the patterns of the same size that surround\nit, and the smaller patterns which are embedded in it.\nThis is a fundamental view of the world, It says that\nwhen you build a thing you cannot merely build that\nthing in isolation, but must also repair the world around\nit, and within it, so that the larger world at that one\nplace becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the\nthing which you make takes its place in the web of na-\nture, as you make it.\nNow we explain the nature of the relation between\nproblems and solutions, within the individual patterns.\nEach solution is stated in such a way that it gives the\nessential field of relationships needed to solve the prob-\nlem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you\ncan solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by\nadapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions\nat the place where you are making it.\nFor this reason, we have tried to write each solution\nin a way which imposes nothing on you. It contains only\nthose essentials which cannot be avoided if you really\nXU\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to solve the problem. In this sense, we have tried,\nin each solution, to capture the invariant property com-\nmon to all places which succeed in solving the problem.\nBut of course, we have not always succeeded. The\nsolutions we have given to these problems vary in signif-\ncance, Some are more true, more profound, more cer-\ntain, than others. To show this clearly we have marked\nevery pattern, in the text itself, with two asterisks, or one\nasterisk, or no asterisks.\nIn the patterns marked with two asterisks, we believe\nthat we have succeeded in stating a true invariant: in\nshort, that the solution we have stated summarizes a\nproperty common to all possible ways of solving the\nstated problem. In these two-asterisk cases we believe,\nin short, that it is not possible to solve the stated prob-\nlem properly, without shaping the environment in one\nway or another according to the pattern that we have\ngiven—and that, in these cases, the pattern describes\na deep and inescapable property of a well-formed en-\nvironment.\nIn the patterns marked with one asterisk, we believe\nthat we have made some progress towards identifying\nsuch an invariant: but that with careful work it will\ncertainly be possible to improve on the solution, In\nthese cases, we believe it would be wise for you to treat\nthe pattern with a certain amount of disrespect—and\nthat you seek out variants of the solution which we have\ngiven, since there are almost certainly possible ranges of\nsolutions which are not covered by what we have written.\nFinally, in the patterns without an asterisk, we are\ncertain that we have mot succeeded in defining a true\nx1V\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\ninvariant—that, on the contrary, there are certainly ways\nof solving the problem different from the one which we\nhave given. In these cases we have still stated a solution,\nin order to be concrete—to provide the reader with at\nleast one way of solving the problem-—but the task of\nfinding the true invariant, the true property which hes\nat the heart of all possible solutions to this problem, re-\nmains undone.\nWe hope, of course, that many of the people who\nread, and use this language, will try to improve these\npatterns—will put their energy to work, in this task of\nfinding more true, more profound invariants—and we\nhope that gradually these more true patterns, which are\nslowly discovered, as time goes on, will enter a common\nlanguage, which all of us can share.\nYou see then that the patterns are very much alive\nand evolving. In fact, if you like, each pattern may be\nlooked upon as a hypothesis like one of the hypotheses of\nscience. In this sense, each pattern represents our current\nbest guess as to what arrangement of the physical envi-\nronment will work to solve the problem presented. The\nempirical questions center on the problem—does it occur\nand is it felt in the way we have described it?—-and the\nsolution—-does the arrangement we propose in fact re-\nsolve the problem? And the asterisks represent our\ndegree of faith in these hypotheses. But of course, no\nmatter what the asterisks say, the patterns are still\nhypotheses, all 253 of them-—-and are therefore all\ntentative, all free to evolve under the impact of new\nexperience and observation.\nLet us finally explain the status of this language, why\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwe have called it “A Pattern Language” with the em-\nphasis on the word “A,” and how we imagine this pat-\ntern language might be related to the countless thou-\nsands of other languages we hope that people will make\nfor themselves, in the future.\nThe Timeless Way of Building says that every society\nwhich is alive and whole, will have its own unique and\ndistinct pattern language; and further, that every in-\ndividual in such a society will have a unique language,\nshared in part, but which as a totality is unique to the\nraind of the person who has it. In this sense, in a healthy\nsociety there will be as many pattern languages as there\nare people—even though these languages are shared and\nsimular,\nThe question then arises: What exactly is the status\nof this published language? In what frame of mind, and\nwith what intention, are we publishing this language\nhere? The fact that it is published as a book means that\nmany thousands of people can use it. Is it not true that\nthere is a danger that people might come to rely on this\none printed language, instead of developing their own\nlanguages, in their own minds?\nThe fact is, that we have written this book as a first\nstep in the society-wide process by which people will\ngradually become conscious of their own pattern lan-\nguages, and work to improve them. We believe, and\nhave explained in The Timeless Way of Building, that\nthe languages which people have today are so brutal, and\nso fragmented, that most people no longer have any\nlanguage to speak of at all—and what they do have is\nnot based on human, or natural considerations.\nXVI\n& PATTERN LANGUAGE\nWe have spent years trying to formulate this lan-\nguage, in the hope that when a person uses tt, he will\nbe so impressed by its power, and so joyful in its use,\nthat he will understand again, what it means to have a\nliving language of this kind. [If we only succeed in that,\nit is possible that each person may once again embark on\nthe construction and development of his own language—\nperhaps taking the language printed in this book, as a\npoint of departure.\nAnd yet, we do believe, of course, that this language\nwhich is printed here is something more than a manual,\nor a teacher, or a version of a possible pattern language.\nMany of the patterns here are archetypal—so deep, so\ndeeply rooted in the nature of things, that it seems likely\nthat they will be a part of human nature, and human ac-\ntion, as much in five hundred years, as they are today.\nWe doubt very much whether anyone could construct\na valid pattern language, in his own mind, which did\nnot include the pattern arcapes (119) for example, or\nthe pattern aLcoves (179).\nIn this sense, we have also tried to penetrate, as deep\nas we are able, into the nature of things in the environ-\nment: and hope that a great part of this language, which\nwe print here, will be a core of any sensible human pat-\ntern language, which any person constructs for himself,\nin his own mind. In this sense, at least a part of the\nlanguage we have presented here, is the archetypal core\nof all possible pattern languages, which can make people\nfeel alive and human.\nXVII\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nA pattern language has the structure of a network. This\nis explained fully in The Timeless Way of Bualdimg.\nHowever, when we use the network of a language, we\nalways use it as a sequence, going through the patterns,\nmoving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,\nalways from the ones which create structures, to the ones\nwhich then embellish those structures, and then to those\nwhich embellish the embellishments. . . .\nSince the language is in truth a network, there is no\none sequence which perfectly captures it. But the se-\nquence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the\nfull network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down,\ndips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little\nlike a needle following a tapestry.\nThe sequence of patterns is both a summary of the\nlanguage, and at the same time, an index to the patterns.\nIf you read through the sentences which connect the\ngroups of patterns to one another, you will get an over-\nview of the whole language. And once you get this over-\nview, you will then be able to find the patterns which\nare relevant to your own project.\nAnd finally, as we shall explain in the next section,\nthis sequence of patterns is also the “base map,” from\nKVL\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nwhich you can make a language for your own project,\nby choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,\nand leaving them more or less in the order that you\nfind them printed here.\nWe begin with that part of the language which defines\na town or community. These patterns can never be “de-\nsigned” or “buil?” in one fell swoop—but patient piece-\nmeal growth, designed in such a way that every indi-\nvidual act is always helping to create or generate these\nlarger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the\nyears, make a community that has these global patterns\nin tk.\nI.

They create\na coherent picture of an entire region, with the power\nto generate such regions in a million forms, with in-\nfinite variety in all the details.\nIt 1s also true that any small sequence of patterns from\nthis language is itself a language for a smaller part of\nthe environment; and this small list of patterns is then\ncapable of generating a million parks, paths, houses,\nworkshops, or gardens.\nFor example, consider the following ten patterns:\nPRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET (140)\nSUNNY PLACE (161)\nOUTDOOR ROOM (163)\nSIX-FOOT BALCONY (167)\nPATHS AND GOALS (120)\nCEILING HEIGHT VARIETY (190)\nCOLUMNS AT THE CORNERS (212)\nFRONT DOOR BENCH (242)\nRAISED FLOWERS (245)\nDIFFERENT CHAIRS (251)\nThis short list of patterns is itself a language: it is one\nof a thousand possible languages for a porch, at the front\nof a house, One of us chose this small language, to build\nAXERV\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBYJECT\na porch onto the front of his house. This is the way the\nlanguage, and its patterns, helped to generate this porch.\nI started with PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE sTREET (140). That\npattern calls for a terrace, slightly raised, connected to the house,\nand on the street side. suNNY PLACE (161) suggests that a special\nplace on the sunny side of the yard should be intensified and\nmade into a place by the use of a patio, balcony, outdoor room,\netc, | used these two patterns to locate a raised platform on the\nsouth side of the house.\nit half under the existing roof overhang, and kept a mature\npyracanthus tree right smack in the middle of the platform. The\noverhead foliage of the tree added to the roof-like enclosure of\nthe space. I put a wind screen of fixed glass on the west side of\nthe platform too, to give it even more enclosure.\nplatform. But this pattern had to be used judiciously and not\nblindly—the reasoning for the pattern has to do with the mini-\nmum space required for people to sit comfortably and carry on a\ndiscussion around a small side-table. Since 1 wanted space for at\nleast two of these conversation areas—one under the roof for very\nfeet square.\nNow PATHS AND Goats (120): Usually, this pattern deals with\nlarge paths in a neighborhood, and comes much earlier in a lan-\nguage. But I used it in a special way. It says that the paths which\nnaturally get formed by people’s walking, on the land, should be\npreserved and intensified. Since the path to our front door cut\nright across the corner of the place where 1 had planned to put\nthe platform, 1 cut the corner of the platform aff.\nThe height of the platform above the ground was determined\nby CEILING HEIGHT varieETY (190). By building the platform\napproximately one foot above the ground line, the ceiling height\nof the covered portion came out at between 6 and 7 feet——just\nright for a space as small as this. Since this height above the\nBOOR BENCH (242) was automatically satisfied.\nThere were three columns standing, supporting the roof over\nXXXVI]ground level is just about right for sitting, the pattern FRONT\nhot or rainy days, and one out under the sky for days when you\nwanted to be full in the sun, the balcony had to be made 12 x 12\nI used six-Foor BaLcony (167) to determine the size of the\nTo make this platform into an ovTsoor Room (163), I put\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nthe old porch, They had to stay where they are, because they hold\nthe roof up. But, following covumns ar THE coRNERs (212),\nthe platform was very carefully tailored to their positions—so that\nthe columns help define the social spaces on either side of them.\nFinally, we put a couple of flower boxes next to the “front door\nbench”—it’s nice to smell them when you sit there—according to\nRAISED FLowERs (245). And the old chairs you can see in the\nporch are DIeFERENT CHAIRS (251).\nYou can see, from this short example, how powerful\nand simple a pattern language is, And you are now,\nperhaps ready to appreciate how careful you must be,\nwhen you construct a language for yourself and your\nown project.\nThe character of the porch is given by the ten patterns\nin this short language. In just this way, each part of the\nenvironment is given its character by the collection of\npatterns which we choose to build into it. The character\nof what you build, will be given to it by the language of\npatterns you use, to generate it.\nXxxvii\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nFor this reason, of course, the task of choosing a lan-\nguage for your project is fundamental. The pattern lan-\nguage we have given here contains 253 patterns. You\ncan therefore use it to generate an almost unimaginably\nlarge number of possible different smaller languages,\nfor all the different projects you may choose to do,\nsimply by picking patterns from it.\nWe shall now describe a rough procedure by which\nyou can choose a language for your own project, first by\ntaking patterns from this language we have printed here,\nand then by adding patterns of your own.\nr. First of all, make a copy of the master sequence\n(pages xix-xxxiv) on which you can tick off the patterns\nwhich will form the language for your project. If you\ndon’t have access to a copying machine, you can tick off\npatterns in the list printed in the book, use paper clips\nto mark pages, write your own list, use paper markers—\nwhatever you like. But just for now, to explain it clearly,\nwe shall assume that you have a copy of the list in front\nof you.\n2. Scan down the list, and find the pattern which\nbest describes the overall scope of the project you have\nin mind, This is the starting pattern for your project.\nTick it. CIE there are two or three possible candidates,\ndon’t worry: just pick the one which seems best: the\nothers will fall in place as you move forward.)\n3. Turn to the starting pattern itself, in the book, and\nread it through. Notice that the other patterns men-\ntioned by name at the beginning and at the end, of the\npattern you are reading, are also possible candidates for\nyour language. The ones at the beginning will tend to be\n“larger” than your project. Don’t include them, unless\nXXXVI\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nyou have the power to help create these patterns, at least\nin a small way, in the world around your project. The\nones at the end are “smaller.” Almost all of them will\nbe important. Tick all of them, on your list, unless you\nhave some special reason for not wanting to include\nthem.\n4. Now your list has some more ticks on it. Turn to\nthe next highest pattern on the list which is ticked, and\nopen the book to that pattern. Once again, it will lead\nyou to other patterns. Once again, tick those which are\nrelevant—especially the ones which are “smaller” that\ncome at the end. As a general rule, do not tick the ones\nwhich are “larger” unless you can do something about\nthem, concretely, in your own project.\n5. When in doubt about a pattern, don’t include it.\nYour list can easily get too long: and if it does, it will\nbecome confusing. The list will be quite long enough,\neven if you only include the patterns you especially like.\n6. Keep going like this, until you have ticked all the\npatterns you want for your project.\n7. Now, adjust the sequence by adding your own ma-\nterial. If there are things you want to include in your\nproject, but you have not been able to find patterns which\ncorrespond to them, then write them in, at an appropri-\nate point in the sequence, near other patterns which are\nof about the same size and importance. For example,\nthere is no pattern for a sauna. If you want to include\none, write it in somewhere near BATHING ROOM (144)\nin your sequence.\n8. And of course, if you want to change any patterns,\nchange them. There are often cases where you may have\na personal version of a pattern, which is more true, or\nXXXIN\nCHOCSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nmore relevant for you. In this case, you will get the most\n“power” over the language, and make it your own most\neffectively, if you write the changes in, at the appropri-\nate places in the book. And, it will be most concrete of\nall, if you change the name of the pattern too—so that\nit captures your own changes clearly.\nyp oe\nSuppose now that you have a language for your proj-\nect. The way to use the language depends very much\non its scale. Patterns dealing with towns can only be\nimplemented gradually, by grass roots action; patterns\nfor a building can be built up in your mind, and marked\nout on the ground; patterns for construction must be\nbuilt physically, on the site. For this reason we have\ngiven three separate instructions, for these three different\nscales. For towns, see page 3; for buildings, see page\n463; for construction, see page 935.\nThe procedures for each of these three scales are de-\nscribed in much more detail with extensive examples,\nin the appropriate chapters of The Timeless Way of\nBuilding. For the town—see chapters 24 and 25; for an\nindividual building—see chapters 20, 21, and 22; and for\nthe process of construction which describes the way a\nbuilding is actually built see chapter 23.\nxh\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nFinally, a note of caution. This language, lke English,\ncan be a medium for prose, or a medium for poetry. The\ndifference between prose and poetry is not that different\nJanpuages are used, but that the same language is used,\ndifferently. In an ordinary English sentence, each word\nhas one meaning, and the sentence too, has one simple\nmeaning. In a poem, the meaning is far more dense.\nEach word carries several meanings; and the sentence\nas a Whole carries an enormous density of interlocking\nmeanings, which together illuminate the whole.\nThe same is true for pattern languages. It is possible\nto make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a\nrather loose way. A building made like this, is an as-\nsembly of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound.\nBut it 1s also possible to put patterns together in such a\nway that many many patterns overlap in the same\nphysical space: the building is very dense; it has many\nmeanings captured in a small space; and through this\ndensity, it becomes profound.\nIn a poern, this kind of density, creates illumination,\nby making identities between words, and meanings,\nwhose identity we have not understood before. In “O\nRose thou art sick,” the rose is identifed with many\nxii\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\ngreater, and more personal things than any rose—and\nthe poem illuminates the person, and the rose, because of\nthis connection. The connection not only illuminates the\nwords, but also illuminates our actual lives.\n© Rose thon art sick,\n‘The invisible worm,\nThat flies in the night\nin the howling storm:\nHas found out thy bed\nOF crimson joy:\nAnd his dark secret Jove\nDoes thy life destroy,\nWILLIAM BLAKE\nThe same exactly, happens in a building, Consider, for\nexample, the two patterns BATHING ROOM (144) and\nSTILL WATER (71). One defines a part of a house where\nyou can bathe yourself slowly, with pleasure, perhaps\nin company; a place to rest your limbs, and to relax. The\nother is a place in a neighborhood, where this is water\nto gaze into, perhaps to swim in, where children can sail\nboats, and splash about, which nourishes those parts of\nourselves which rely on water as one of the great\nelements of the unconscious.\nSuppose now, that we make a complex of buildings\nwhere individual bathing rooms are somehow connected\nto a common pond, or lake, or pool—where the bathing\nroom merges with this common place; where there is no\nsharp distinction between the individual and family pro-\ncesses of the bathing room, and the common pleasure\nof the common pool. In this place, these two patterns\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nexist in the same space; they are identified, there is a\ncompression of the two, which requires less space, and\nwhich is more profound than in a place where they are\nmerely side by side. The compression illuminates each\nof the patterns, sheds light on its meaning; and also i-\nluminates our lives, as we understand a little more about\nthe connections of our inner needs.\nBut this kind of compression is not only poetic and\nprofound. It is not only the stuff of poems and exotic\nstatements, but to some degree, the stuff of every English\nsentence. To some depree, there is compression in every\nsingle word we utter, just because each word carries the\nwhisper of the meanings of the words it is connected to.\nEven “Please pass the butter, Fred” has some compres-\nsion in it, because it carries overtones that lie in the con-\nnections of these words to all the words which came be-\nfore it.\nFach of us, talking to our friends, or to our families,\nmakes use of these compressions, which are drawn out\nfrom the connections between words which are given by\nthe language. The more we can feel all the connections\nin the language, the more rich and subtle are the things\nwe say at the most ordinary times.\nAnd once again, the same is true in building. The com-\npression of patterns into a single space, is not a poetic\nand exotic thing, kept for special buildings which are\nworks of art. It is the most ordinary economy of space. It\nis quite possible that all the patterns for a house might,\nin some form be present, and overlapping, in a simple\none-room cabin, The patterns do not need to be strung\nout, and kept separate. Every building, every room,\nxd\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nevery garden is better, when all the patterns which it\nneeds are compressed as far as it is possible for them to\nbe. The building will be cheaper; and the meanings in it\nwill be denser.\nIt is essential then, once you have learned to use the\nlanguage, that you pay attention to the possibility of\ncompressing the many patterns which you put together,\nin the smallest possible space. You may think of this\nprocess of compressing patterns, as a way to make the\ncheapest possible building which has the necessary pat-\nterns in it. It is, also, the only way of using a pattern\nlanguage to make buildings which are poems.\n","summary":"This chunk discusses the \"Magic of the City\" pattern, which is part of the larger pattern language for designing towns and communities. It explains the importance of decentralizing urban centers to create multiple smaller centers, each with its own unique character and offerings, in order to make the \"magic of the city\" accessible to more people.","chunk":"# Io Magic Of The City\n\n![1_Image_0.Png](1_Image_0.Png)\n\n. . . next to the MOSAIC OF SUBCULTURES (8), perhaps the most important structural feature of a city is the pattern of those centers where the city life is most intense. These centers can help to form the mosaic of subcultures by their variety; and they can also help to form crry country FINGERS (3), if each of the centers is at a natural meeting point of several fingers. This pattern was first written by Luis Racionero, under the name\n\"Downtowns of 300,000.\"\n\n## မျိုးများ မြို့နယ်ရှိ ရွာများ\n\nThere are few people who do not enjoy the magic of a great city. But urban sprawl takes it away from everyone except the few who are lucky enough, or rich enough, to live close to the largest centers.\n\nThis is bound to happen in any urban region with a single high density core. Land near the core is expensive; few people can live near enough to it to give them genuine access to the city's life; most people live far out from the core. To all intents and purposes, they are in the suburbs and have no more than occasional access to the city's life. This problem can only be solved by decentralizing the core to form a multitude of smaller cores, each devoted to some special way of life, so that, even though decentralized, each one is still intense and still a center for the region as a whole.\n\nThe mechanism which creates a single isolated core is simple.\n\nUrban services tend to agglomerate. Restaurants, theaters, shops, carnivals, cafes, hotels, night clubs, entertainment, special services, tend to cluster. They do so because each one wants to locate in that position where the most people are. As soon as one nucleus has formed in a city, each of the interesting services-especially those which are most interesting and therefore require the largest catch basin-locate themselves in this one nucleus. The one nucleus keeps growing. The downtown becomes enormous. It becomes rich, various, fascinating. But gradually, as the metropolitan area grows, the average distance from an individual house\n\n## રે તે\n\nto this one center increases; and land values around the center rise so high that houses are driven out from there by shops and offices-until soon no one, or almost no one, is any longer genuinely in touch with the magic which is created day and night within this solitary center.\n\nThe problem is clear. On the one hand people will only expend so much effort to get goods and services and attend cultural events, even the very best ones. On the other hand, real variety and choice can only occur where there is concentrated, centralized activity; and when the concentration and centralization become too great, then people are no longer willing to take the time to go to it.\n\nIf we are to resolve the problem by decentralizing centers, we must ask what the minimum population is that can support a central business district with the magic of the city. Oris D.\n\nDuncan in \"The Optimum Size of Cities\" (Cities and Society, P. K. Hatt and A. J. Reiss, eds., New York: The Free Press, 1967, pp. 759-72), shows that cities with more than 50,000 people have a big enough market to sustain 61 different kinds of retail shops and that cities with over 100,000 people can support sophisticated jewelry, fur, and fashion stores. He shows that cities of 100,000 can support a university, a museum, a library, a zoo, a symphony orchestra, a daily newspaper, AM and FM radio, but that it takes a population of 250,000 to 500,000 to support a specialized professional school like a medical school, an opera, or all of the TV networks.\n\nIn a study of regional shopping centers in metropolitan Chicago, Brian K. Berry found that centers with 70 kinds of retail shops serve a population base of about 350,000 people\n(Geography of Market Centers and Retail Distribution, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, 1967, p. 47). T. R. Lakshmanan and Walter G. Hansen, in \"A Retail Potential Model\" (American Institute of Planners Journal, May 1965, pp. 134-43), showed that full-scale centers with a variety of retail and professional services, as well as recreational and cultural activities, are feasible for groups of 100,000 to 200,000 population.\n\nIt seems quite possible, then, to get very complex and rich urban functions at the heart of a catch basin which serves no more than 300,000 people. Since, for the reasons given earlier, it is\n\nIO MAGIC OF THE CITY\ndesirable to have as many centers as possible, we propose that the city region should have one center for each 300,000 people, with the centers spaced out widely among the population, so that every person in the region is reasonably close to at least one of these major centers.\n\nTo make this more concrete, it is interesting to get some idea of the range of distances between these centers in a typical urban region. At a density of 5000 persons per square mile (the density of the less populated parts of Los Angeles) the area occupied by 300,000 will have a diameter of about nine miles; at a higher density of 80,000 persons per square mile (the density of central Paris) the area occupied by 300,000 people has a diameter of about two miles. Other patterns in this language suggest a city much more dense than Los Angeles, yet somewhat less dense than central Paris-FOUR-STORY LIMIT (21), DENSITY RINGS (29). We therefore take these crude estimates as upper and lower bounds. If each center serves 300,000 people, they will be at least two miles apart and probably no more than nine miles apart.\n\nOne final point must be discussed. The magic of a great city comes from the enormous specialization of human effort there.\n\nOnly a city such as New York can support a restaurant where you can eat chocolate-covered ants, or buy three-hundred-year-old books of poems, or find a Caribbean steel band playing with American folk singers. By comparison, a city of 300,000 with a second-rate opera, a couple of large department stores, and half a dozen good restaurants is a hick town. It would be absurd if the new downtowns, each serving 300,000 people, in an effort to capture the magic of the city, ended up as a multitude of secondclass hick towns.\n\nThis problem can only be solved if each of the cores not only serves a catch basin of 300,000 people but also offers some kind of special quality which none of the other centers have, so that each core, though small, serves several million people and can therefore generate all the excitement and uniqueness which become possible in such a vast city.\n\nThus, as it is in Tokyo or London, the pattern must be implemented in such a way that one core has the best hotels, another the best antique shops, another the music, still another has the fish and sailing boats. Then we can be sure that every person is\n\n## Q I\n\nwithin reach of at least one downtown and also that all the downtowns are worth reaching for and really have the magic of a great metropolis.\n\nTherefore:\nPut the magic of the city within reach of everyone in a metropolitan area. Do this by means of collective regional policies which restrict the growth of downtown areas so strongly that no one downtown can grow to serve more than 300,000 people. With this population base, the downtowns will be between two and nine miles apart.\n\n![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)\n\n* * *\nTreat each downtown as a pedestrian and local transport area-\nLOCAL TRANSPORT AREAS (II), PROMENADE (31), with good transit connections from the outlying areas-web or PUBLIC\nTRANSPORTATION (16); encourage a rich concentration of night life within each downtown-NIGHT LIFE (33), and set aside at least some part of it for the wildest kind of street life-CARNIVAL\n(58), DANCING IN THE STREET (63). . . .","embeddings":[null]},{"document":"A PATTERN LANGUAGE\nVolume 1, The Timeless Way of Building, and Volume\n2, 4 Patrern Language, are two halves of a single work.\nThis book provides a language, for building and plan-\nning; the other book provides the theory and instruc-\ntions for the use of the language. This book. describes the\ndetailed patterns for towns and neighborhoods, houses,\ngardens, and rooms. The other book explains the disci-\npline which makes it possible to use these patterns to\ncreate a building or a town. This book is the sourcebook of\nthe timeless way; the other is its practice and its origin.\nThe two books have evolved very much in parallel.\nThey have been growing over the last eight years, as\nwe have worked on the one hand to understand the\nnature of the building process, and on the other hand to\nconstruct an actual, possible pattern language. We have\nbeen forced by practical considerations, to publish these\ntwo books under separate covers; but in fact, they form\nan indivisible whole. It is possible to read them sepa-\nrately. But to gain the insight which we have tried to\ncommunicate in them, it is essential that you read them\nboth.\nThe Timeless Way of Building describes the funda-\nmental nature of the task of making towns and buildings.\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nIt is shown there, that towns and buildings will not be\nable to become alive, unless they are made by all the\npeople in society, and unless these people share a com-\nmon pattern language, within which to make these\nbuildings, and unless this cornmon pattern language is\nalive itself.\nTn this book, we present one possible pattern language,\nof the kind called for in The Timeless Way. This lan-\nguage is extremely practical. It is a language that we\nhave distilled from our own building and planning ef-\nforts over the last eight years. You can use it to work\nwith your neighbors, to improve your town and neighbor-\nhood. You can use it to design a house for yourself,\nwith your family; or to work with other people to de-\nsign an office or a workshop or a public building like a\nschool. And you can use it to guide you in the actual\nprocess of construction.\nThe elements of this language are entities called pat-\nterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs\nover and over again in our environment, and then\ndescribes the core of the solution to that problem, in such\na way that you can use this solution a million times over,\nwithout ever doing it the same way twice.\nFor convenience and clarity, each pattern has the same\nformat. First, there is a picture, which shows an arche-\ntypal example of that pattern. Second, after the picture,\neach pattern has an introductory paragraph, which sets\nthe context for the pattern, by explaining how it helps\nto complete certain larger patterns. Then there are three\ndiamonds to mark the beginning of the problem. After\nthe diamonds there is a headline, in bold type. This\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nheadline gives the essence of the problem in one or two\nsentences. After the headline comes the body of the\nproblem. This is the longest section. It describes the\nempirical background of the pattern, the evidence for its\nvalidity, the range of different ways the pattern can be\nmanifested in a building, and so on. Then, again in\nbold type, like the headline, is the solution—the heart\nof the pattern—which describes the field of physical and\nsocial relationships which are required to solve the stated\nproblem, in the stated context. This solution is always\nexactly what you need to do, to build the pattern. Then,\nafter the solution, there is a diagram, which shows the\nsolution in the form of a diagram, with labels to indicate\nits main components.\nAfter the diagram, another three diamonds, to show\nthat the main body of the pattern is finished. And finally,\nafter the diamonds there is a paragraph which ties the\npattern to all those smaller patterns in the language,\nwhich are needed to complete this pattern, to embellish\nit, to All it out.\nThere are two essential purposes behind this format.\nFirst, to present each pattern connected to other patterns,\nso that you grasp the collection of all 253 patterns as a\nwhole, as a language, within which you can create an in-\nfinite variety of combinations. Second, to present the\nproblem and solution of each pattern in such a way that\nyou can judge it for yourself, and modify it, without\nlosing the essence that is central to it.\nLet us next understand the nature of the connection\nbetween patterns.\nXI\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nThe patterns are ordered, beginning with the very\nlargest, for regions and towns, then working down\nthrough neighborhoods, clusters of buildings, buildings,\nrooms and alcoves, ending finally with details of con-\nstruction.\nThis order, which is presented as a straight linear\nsequerice, is essential to the way the language works. It is\npresented, and explained more fully, in the next section.\nWhat is most important about this sequence, is that it is\nbased on the connections between the patterns. Each\npattern is connected to certain “larger” patterns which\ncome above it in the language; and to certain “smaller”\npatterns which come below it in the language. The pat-\ntern helps to complete those larger patterns which are\n“above” it, and is itself completed by those smaller pat-\nterns which are “below” it.\nThus, for example, you will find that the pattern ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN (60), is connected first to certain larger\npatterns: SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY (13), IDENTIFIABLE\nNEIGHBORHOOD (14), WORK COMMUNITY (41), and\nquirr Backs (59). These appear on its first page. And it\nis also connected to certain smaller patterns: PosiTIVE\nOUTDOOR SPACE (107), TREE PLACES (171), and GARDEN\nWALL (173). These appear on its last page.\nWhat this means, is that IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBOR-\nHOOD, SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, WORK COMMUNITY, and\nQUIET BACKS are incomplete, unless they contain an ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN; and that an ACCESSIBLE GREEN is itself\nincomplete, unless it contains POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nAnd what it means in practical terms is that, if you\nx\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to lay out a green according to this pattern, you\nmust not only follow the instructions which describe the\npattern itself, but must also try to embed the green\nWithin an IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD or in some sUB-\nCULTURE BOUNDARY, and in a way that helps to form\nquizr Backs; and then you must work to complete the\ngreen by building in some posiTIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nIn short, no pattern is an isolated entity. Each pattern\ncan exist in the world, only to the extent that is sup-\nported by other patterns: the larger patterns in which it\nis embedded, the patterns of the same size that surround\nit, and the smaller patterns which are embedded in it.\nThis is a fundamental view of the world, It says that\nwhen you build a thing you cannot merely build that\nthing in isolation, but must also repair the world around\nit, and within it, so that the larger world at that one\nplace becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the\nthing which you make takes its place in the web of na-\nture, as you make it.\nNow we explain the nature of the relation between\nproblems and solutions, within the individual patterns.\nEach solution is stated in such a way that it gives the\nessential field of relationships needed to solve the prob-\nlem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you\ncan solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by\nadapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions\nat the place where you are making it.\nFor this reason, we have tried to write each solution\nin a way which imposes nothing on you. It contains only\nthose essentials which cannot be avoided if you really\nXU\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to solve the problem. In this sense, we have tried,\nin each solution, to capture the invariant property com-\nmon to all places which succeed in solving the problem.\nBut of course, we have not always succeeded. The\nsolutions we have given to these problems vary in signif-\ncance, Some are more true, more profound, more cer-\ntain, than others. To show this clearly we have marked\nevery pattern, in the text itself, with two asterisks, or one\nasterisk, or no asterisks.\nIn the patterns marked with two asterisks, we believe\nthat we have succeeded in stating a true invariant: in\nshort, that the solution we have stated summarizes a\nproperty common to all possible ways of solving the\nstated problem. In these two-asterisk cases we believe,\nin short, that it is not possible to solve the stated prob-\nlem properly, without shaping the environment in one\nway or another according to the pattern that we have\ngiven—and that, in these cases, the pattern describes\na deep and inescapable property of a well-formed en-\nvironment.\nIn the patterns marked with one asterisk, we believe\nthat we have made some progress towards identifying\nsuch an invariant: but that with careful work it will\ncertainly be possible to improve on the solution, In\nthese cases, we believe it would be wise for you to treat\nthe pattern with a certain amount of disrespect—and\nthat you seek out variants of the solution which we have\ngiven, since there are almost certainly possible ranges of\nsolutions which are not covered by what we have written.\nFinally, in the patterns without an asterisk, we are\ncertain that we have mot succeeded in defining a true\nx1V\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\ninvariant—that, on the contrary, there are certainly ways\nof solving the problem different from the one which we\nhave given. In these cases we have still stated a solution,\nin order to be concrete—to provide the reader with at\nleast one way of solving the problem-—but the task of\nfinding the true invariant, the true property which hes\nat the heart of all possible solutions to this problem, re-\nmains undone.\nWe hope, of course, that many of the people who\nread, and use this language, will try to improve these\npatterns—will put their energy to work, in this task of\nfinding more true, more profound invariants—and we\nhope that gradually these more true patterns, which are\nslowly discovered, as time goes on, will enter a common\nlanguage, which all of us can share.\nYou see then that the patterns are very much alive\nand evolving. In fact, if you like, each pattern may be\nlooked upon as a hypothesis like one of the hypotheses of\nscience. In this sense, each pattern represents our current\nbest guess as to what arrangement of the physical envi-\nronment will work to solve the problem presented. The\nempirical questions center on the problem—does it occur\nand is it felt in the way we have described it?—-and the\nsolution—-does the arrangement we propose in fact re-\nsolve the problem? And the asterisks represent our\ndegree of faith in these hypotheses. But of course, no\nmatter what the asterisks say, the patterns are still\nhypotheses, all 253 of them-—-and are therefore all\ntentative, all free to evolve under the impact of new\nexperience and observation.\nLet us finally explain the status of this language, why\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwe have called it “A Pattern Language” with the em-\nphasis on the word “A,” and how we imagine this pat-\ntern language might be related to the countless thou-\nsands of other languages we hope that people will make\nfor themselves, in the future.\nThe Timeless Way of Building says that every society\nwhich is alive and whole, will have its own unique and\ndistinct pattern language; and further, that every in-\ndividual in such a society will have a unique language,\nshared in part, but which as a totality is unique to the\nraind of the person who has it. In this sense, in a healthy\nsociety there will be as many pattern languages as there\nare people—even though these languages are shared and\nsimular,\nThe question then arises: What exactly is the status\nof this published language? In what frame of mind, and\nwith what intention, are we publishing this language\nhere? The fact that it is published as a book means that\nmany thousands of people can use it. Is it not true that\nthere is a danger that people might come to rely on this\none printed language, instead of developing their own\nlanguages, in their own minds?\nThe fact is, that we have written this book as a first\nstep in the society-wide process by which people will\ngradually become conscious of their own pattern lan-\nguages, and work to improve them. We believe, and\nhave explained in The Timeless Way of Building, that\nthe languages which people have today are so brutal, and\nso fragmented, that most people no longer have any\nlanguage to speak of at all—and what they do have is\nnot based on human, or natural considerations.\nXVI\n& PATTERN LANGUAGE\nWe have spent years trying to formulate this lan-\nguage, in the hope that when a person uses tt, he will\nbe so impressed by its power, and so joyful in its use,\nthat he will understand again, what it means to have a\nliving language of this kind. [If we only succeed in that,\nit is possible that each person may once again embark on\nthe construction and development of his own language—\nperhaps taking the language printed in this book, as a\npoint of departure.\nAnd yet, we do believe, of course, that this language\nwhich is printed here is something more than a manual,\nor a teacher, or a version of a possible pattern language.\nMany of the patterns here are archetypal—so deep, so\ndeeply rooted in the nature of things, that it seems likely\nthat they will be a part of human nature, and human ac-\ntion, as much in five hundred years, as they are today.\nWe doubt very much whether anyone could construct\na valid pattern language, in his own mind, which did\nnot include the pattern arcapes (119) for example, or\nthe pattern aLcoves (179).\nIn this sense, we have also tried to penetrate, as deep\nas we are able, into the nature of things in the environ-\nment: and hope that a great part of this language, which\nwe print here, will be a core of any sensible human pat-\ntern language, which any person constructs for himself,\nin his own mind. In this sense, at least a part of the\nlanguage we have presented here, is the archetypal core\nof all possible pattern languages, which can make people\nfeel alive and human.\nXVII\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nA pattern language has the structure of a network. This\nis explained fully in The Timeless Way of Bualdimg.\nHowever, when we use the network of a language, we\nalways use it as a sequence, going through the patterns,\nmoving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,\nalways from the ones which create structures, to the ones\nwhich then embellish those structures, and then to those\nwhich embellish the embellishments. . . .\nSince the language is in truth a network, there is no\none sequence which perfectly captures it. But the se-\nquence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the\nfull network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down,\ndips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little\nlike a needle following a tapestry.\nThe sequence of patterns is both a summary of the\nlanguage, and at the same time, an index to the patterns.\nIf you read through the sentences which connect the\ngroups of patterns to one another, you will get an over-\nview of the whole language. And once you get this over-\nview, you will then be able to find the patterns which\nare relevant to your own project.\nAnd finally, as we shall explain in the next section,\nthis sequence of patterns is also the “base map,” from\nKVL\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nwhich you can make a language for your own project,\nby choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,\nand leaving them more or less in the order that you\nfind them printed here.\nWe begin with that part of the language which defines\na town or community. These patterns can never be “de-\nsigned” or “buil?” in one fell swoop—but patient piece-\nmeal growth, designed in such a way that every indi-\nvidual act is always helping to create or generate these\nlarger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the\nyears, make a community that has these global patterns\nin tk.\nI.

They create\na coherent picture of an entire region, with the power\nto generate such regions in a million forms, with in-\nfinite variety in all the details.\nIt 1s also true that any small sequence of patterns from\nthis language is itself a language for a smaller part of\nthe environment; and this small list of patterns is then\ncapable of generating a million parks, paths, houses,\nworkshops, or gardens.\nFor example, consider the following ten patterns:\nPRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET (140)\nSUNNY PLACE (161)\nOUTDOOR ROOM (163)\nSIX-FOOT BALCONY (167)\nPATHS AND GOALS (120)\nCEILING HEIGHT VARIETY (190)\nCOLUMNS AT THE CORNERS (212)\nFRONT DOOR BENCH (242)\nRAISED FLOWERS (245)\nDIFFERENT CHAIRS (251)\nThis short list of patterns is itself a language: it is one\nof a thousand possible languages for a porch, at the front\nof a house, One of us chose this small language, to build\nAXERV\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBYJECT\na porch onto the front of his house. This is the way the\nlanguage, and its patterns, helped to generate this porch.\nI started with PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE sTREET (140). That\npattern calls for a terrace, slightly raised, connected to the house,\nand on the street side. suNNY PLACE (161) suggests that a special\nplace on the sunny side of the yard should be intensified and\nmade into a place by the use of a patio, balcony, outdoor room,\netc, | used these two patterns to locate a raised platform on the\nsouth side of the house.\nit half under the existing roof overhang, and kept a mature\npyracanthus tree right smack in the middle of the platform. The\noverhead foliage of the tree added to the roof-like enclosure of\nthe space. I put a wind screen of fixed glass on the west side of\nthe platform too, to give it even more enclosure.\nplatform. But this pattern had to be used judiciously and not\nblindly—the reasoning for the pattern has to do with the mini-\nmum space required for people to sit comfortably and carry on a\ndiscussion around a small side-table. Since 1 wanted space for at\nleast two of these conversation areas—one under the roof for very\nfeet square.\nNow PATHS AND Goats (120): Usually, this pattern deals with\nlarge paths in a neighborhood, and comes much earlier in a lan-\nguage. But I used it in a special way. It says that the paths which\nnaturally get formed by people’s walking, on the land, should be\npreserved and intensified. Since the path to our front door cut\nright across the corner of the place where 1 had planned to put\nthe platform, 1 cut the corner of the platform aff.\nThe height of the platform above the ground was determined\nby CEILING HEIGHT varieETY (190). By building the platform\napproximately one foot above the ground line, the ceiling height\nof the covered portion came out at between 6 and 7 feet——just\nright for a space as small as this. Since this height above the\nBOOR BENCH (242) was automatically satisfied.\nThere were three columns standing, supporting the roof over\nXXXVI]ground level is just about right for sitting, the pattern FRONT\nhot or rainy days, and one out under the sky for days when you\nwanted to be full in the sun, the balcony had to be made 12 x 12\nI used six-Foor BaLcony (167) to determine the size of the\nTo make this platform into an ovTsoor Room (163), I put\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nthe old porch, They had to stay where they are, because they hold\nthe roof up. But, following covumns ar THE coRNERs (212),\nthe platform was very carefully tailored to their positions—so that\nthe columns help define the social spaces on either side of them.\nFinally, we put a couple of flower boxes next to the “front door\nbench”—it’s nice to smell them when you sit there—according to\nRAISED FLowERs (245). And the old chairs you can see in the\nporch are DIeFERENT CHAIRS (251).\nYou can see, from this short example, how powerful\nand simple a pattern language is, And you are now,\nperhaps ready to appreciate how careful you must be,\nwhen you construct a language for yourself and your\nown project.\nThe character of the porch is given by the ten patterns\nin this short language. In just this way, each part of the\nenvironment is given its character by the collection of\npatterns which we choose to build into it. The character\nof what you build, will be given to it by the language of\npatterns you use, to generate it.\nXxxvii\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nFor this reason, of course, the task of choosing a lan-\nguage for your project is fundamental. The pattern lan-\nguage we have given here contains 253 patterns. You\ncan therefore use it to generate an almost unimaginably\nlarge number of possible different smaller languages,\nfor all the different projects you may choose to do,\nsimply by picking patterns from it.\nWe shall now describe a rough procedure by which\nyou can choose a language for your own project, first by\ntaking patterns from this language we have printed here,\nand then by adding patterns of your own.\nr. First of all, make a copy of the master sequence\n(pages xix-xxxiv) on which you can tick off the patterns\nwhich will form the language for your project. If you\ndon’t have access to a copying machine, you can tick off\npatterns in the list printed in the book, use paper clips\nto mark pages, write your own list, use paper markers—\nwhatever you like. But just for now, to explain it clearly,\nwe shall assume that you have a copy of the list in front\nof you.\n2. Scan down the list, and find the pattern which\nbest describes the overall scope of the project you have\nin mind, This is the starting pattern for your project.\nTick it. CIE there are two or three possible candidates,\ndon’t worry: just pick the one which seems best: the\nothers will fall in place as you move forward.)\n3. Turn to the starting pattern itself, in the book, and\nread it through. Notice that the other patterns men-\ntioned by name at the beginning and at the end, of the\npattern you are reading, are also possible candidates for\nyour language. The ones at the beginning will tend to be\n“larger” than your project. Don’t include them, unless\nXXXVI\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nyou have the power to help create these patterns, at least\nin a small way, in the world around your project. The\nones at the end are “smaller.” Almost all of them will\nbe important. Tick all of them, on your list, unless you\nhave some special reason for not wanting to include\nthem.\n4. Now your list has some more ticks on it. Turn to\nthe next highest pattern on the list which is ticked, and\nopen the book to that pattern. Once again, it will lead\nyou to other patterns. Once again, tick those which are\nrelevant—especially the ones which are “smaller” that\ncome at the end. As a general rule, do not tick the ones\nwhich are “larger” unless you can do something about\nthem, concretely, in your own project.\n5. When in doubt about a pattern, don’t include it.\nYour list can easily get too long: and if it does, it will\nbecome confusing. The list will be quite long enough,\neven if you only include the patterns you especially like.\n6. Keep going like this, until you have ticked all the\npatterns you want for your project.\n7. Now, adjust the sequence by adding your own ma-\nterial. If there are things you want to include in your\nproject, but you have not been able to find patterns which\ncorrespond to them, then write them in, at an appropri-\nate point in the sequence, near other patterns which are\nof about the same size and importance. For example,\nthere is no pattern for a sauna. If you want to include\none, write it in somewhere near BATHING ROOM (144)\nin your sequence.\n8. And of course, if you want to change any patterns,\nchange them. There are often cases where you may have\na personal version of a pattern, which is more true, or\nXXXIN\nCHOCSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nmore relevant for you. In this case, you will get the most\n“power” over the language, and make it your own most\neffectively, if you write the changes in, at the appropri-\nate places in the book. And, it will be most concrete of\nall, if you change the name of the pattern too—so that\nit captures your own changes clearly.\nyp oe\nSuppose now that you have a language for your proj-\nect. The way to use the language depends very much\non its scale. Patterns dealing with towns can only be\nimplemented gradually, by grass roots action; patterns\nfor a building can be built up in your mind, and marked\nout on the ground; patterns for construction must be\nbuilt physically, on the site. For this reason we have\ngiven three separate instructions, for these three different\nscales. For towns, see page 3; for buildings, see page\n463; for construction, see page 935.\nThe procedures for each of these three scales are de-\nscribed in much more detail with extensive examples,\nin the appropriate chapters of The Timeless Way of\nBuilding. For the town—see chapters 24 and 25; for an\nindividual building—see chapters 20, 21, and 22; and for\nthe process of construction which describes the way a\nbuilding is actually built see chapter 23.\nxh\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nFinally, a note of caution. This language, lke English,\ncan be a medium for prose, or a medium for poetry. The\ndifference between prose and poetry is not that different\nJanpuages are used, but that the same language is used,\ndifferently. In an ordinary English sentence, each word\nhas one meaning, and the sentence too, has one simple\nmeaning. In a poem, the meaning is far more dense.\nEach word carries several meanings; and the sentence\nas a Whole carries an enormous density of interlocking\nmeanings, which together illuminate the whole.\nThe same is true for pattern languages. It is possible\nto make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a\nrather loose way. A building made like this, is an as-\nsembly of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound.\nBut it 1s also possible to put patterns together in such a\nway that many many patterns overlap in the same\nphysical space: the building is very dense; it has many\nmeanings captured in a small space; and through this\ndensity, it becomes profound.\nIn a poern, this kind of density, creates illumination,\nby making identities between words, and meanings,\nwhose identity we have not understood before. In “O\nRose thou art sick,” the rose is identifed with many\nxii\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\ngreater, and more personal things than any rose—and\nthe poem illuminates the person, and the rose, because of\nthis connection. The connection not only illuminates the\nwords, but also illuminates our actual lives.\n© Rose thon art sick,\n‘The invisible worm,\nThat flies in the night\nin the howling storm:\nHas found out thy bed\nOF crimson joy:\nAnd his dark secret Jove\nDoes thy life destroy,\nWILLIAM BLAKE\nThe same exactly, happens in a building, Consider, for\nexample, the two patterns BATHING ROOM (144) and\nSTILL WATER (71). One defines a part of a house where\nyou can bathe yourself slowly, with pleasure, perhaps\nin company; a place to rest your limbs, and to relax. The\nother is a place in a neighborhood, where this is water\nto gaze into, perhaps to swim in, where children can sail\nboats, and splash about, which nourishes those parts of\nourselves which rely on water as one of the great\nelements of the unconscious.\nSuppose now, that we make a complex of buildings\nwhere individual bathing rooms are somehow connected\nto a common pond, or lake, or pool—where the bathing\nroom merges with this common place; where there is no\nsharp distinction between the individual and family pro-\ncesses of the bathing room, and the common pleasure\nof the common pool. In this place, these two patterns\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nexist in the same space; they are identified, there is a\ncompression of the two, which requires less space, and\nwhich is more profound than in a place where they are\nmerely side by side. The compression illuminates each\nof the patterns, sheds light on its meaning; and also i-\nluminates our lives, as we understand a little more about\nthe connections of our inner needs.\nBut this kind of compression is not only poetic and\nprofound. It is not only the stuff of poems and exotic\nstatements, but to some degree, the stuff of every English\nsentence. To some depree, there is compression in every\nsingle word we utter, just because each word carries the\nwhisper of the meanings of the words it is connected to.\nEven “Please pass the butter, Fred” has some compres-\nsion in it, because it carries overtones that lie in the con-\nnections of these words to all the words which came be-\nfore it.\nFach of us, talking to our friends, or to our families,\nmakes use of these compressions, which are drawn out\nfrom the connections between words which are given by\nthe language. The more we can feel all the connections\nin the language, the more rich and subtle are the things\nwe say at the most ordinary times.\nAnd once again, the same is true in building. The com-\npression of patterns into a single space, is not a poetic\nand exotic thing, kept for special buildings which are\nworks of art. It is the most ordinary economy of space. It\nis quite possible that all the patterns for a house might,\nin some form be present, and overlapping, in a simple\none-room cabin, The patterns do not need to be strung\nout, and kept separate. Every building, every room,\nxd\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nevery garden is better, when all the patterns which it\nneeds are compressed as far as it is possible for them to\nbe. The building will be cheaper; and the meanings in it\nwill be denser.\nIt is essential then, once you have learned to use the\nlanguage, that you pay attention to the possibility of\ncompressing the many patterns which you put together,\nin the smallest possible space. You may think of this\nprocess of compressing patterns, as a way to make the\ncheapest possible building which has the necessary pat-\nterns in it. It is, also, the only way of using a pattern\nlanguage to make buildings which are poems.\n","summary":"This chunk discusses the pattern \"Nine Per Cent Parking\", which is part of the larger pattern language described in the book \"A Pattern Language\". The pattern proposes limiting the amount of land used for parking to no more than 9% in order to maintain the integrity and tranquility of local communities and neighborhoods.","chunk":"# 22 Nine Per Cent\n\n![63_Image_0.Png](63_Image_0.Png) Parking**\n\n. . . the integrity of local transport areas and the tranquility of local communities and neighborhoods depend very much on the amount of parking they provide. The more parking they provide, the less possible it will be to maintain these patterns, because the parking spaces will attract cars, which in turn violate the local transport arcas and neighborhoods-Local TRANSPORT AREAS (II), COMMUNITY OF 7000 (I2), IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD\n(14). This pattern proposes radical limits on the distribution of parking spaces, to protect communities.\n\nVery simply-when the area devoted to parking is too\n\n![64_image_0.png](64_image_0.png)\n\ngreat, it destroys the land.\n\nIn downtown Los Angeles over 60 per cent of the land is goven over to the automobile.\nVery rough empirical observations lead us to believe that it is not possible to make an environment fit for human use when more than 9 per cent of it is given to parking.\n\nOur observations are very tentative. We have yet to perform systematic studies-our observations rely on our own subjective estimates of cases where \"there are too many cars\" and cases where\n\"the cars are all right.\" However, we have found in our preliminary observations, that different people agree to a remarkable extent about these estimates. This suggests that we are dealing with a phenomenon which, though obscure, is nonetheless substantial.\n\nAn example of an environment which has the threshold density of 9 per cent parking, is shown in our key photograph: a quadrant\n\nof the University of Oregon. Many people we have talked to feel intuitively that this area is beautiful now, but that if more cars were parked there it would be ruined.\n\nWhat possible functional basis is there for this intuition? We conjecture as follows: people realize, subconsciously, that the physical environment is the medium for their social intercourse. It is the environment which, when it is working properly, creates the potential for all social communion, including even communion with the self.\n\nWe suspect that when the density of cars passes a certain limit, and people experience the feeling that there are too many cars, what is really happening is that subconsciously they feel that the cars are overwhelming the environment, that the environment is no longer \"theirs,\" that they have no right to be there, that it is not a place for people, and so on. After all, the effect of the cars reaches far beyond the mere presence of the cars themselves. They create a maze of driveways, garage doors, asphalt and concrete surfaces, and building elements which people cannot use. When the density goes beyond the limit, we suspect that people feel the social potential of the environment has disappeared. Instead of inviting them out, the environment starts giving them the message that the outdoors is not meant for them, that they should stay indoors, that they should stay in their own buildings, that social communion is no longer permitted or encouraged.\n\nWe have not yes tested this suspicion. However, if it turns out to be true, it may be that this pattern, which seems to be based on such slender evidence, is in fact one of the most crucial patterns there is, and that it plays a key role in determining the difference between environments which are socially and psychologically healthy and those which are unhealthy.\n\nWe conjecture, then, that environments which are human, and not destroyed socially or ecologically by the presence of parked cars, have less than 9 per cent of the ground area devoted to parking space; and that parking lots and garages must therefore never be allowed to cover more than 9 per cent of the land.\n\nIt is essential to interpret this pattern in the strictest possible way. The pattern becomes meaningless if we allow ourselves to place the parking generated by a piece of land A, on another adjacent piece of land B, thus keeping parking on A below 9 per\n\n## I 2 2\n\ncent, but raising the parking on B to more than 9 per cent. In other words, each piece of land must take care of itself; we must not allow ourselves to solve this problem on one piece of land at the expense of some other piece of land. A town or a community can only implement the pattern according to this strict interpretation by defining a grid of independent \"parking zones\"-each zone I to 10 acres in area-which cover the whole community, and then insisting that the rule be applied, independently, and strictly, inside every parking zone.\n\nThe 9 per cent rule has a clear and immediate implication for the balance between surface parking and parking in garages, at different parking densities. This follows from simple arithmetic.\n\nSuppose, for example, that an area requires 20 parking spaces per acre. Twenty parking spaces will consume about 7000 square feet, which would be 17 per cent of the land if it were all in surface parking. To keep 20 cars per acre in line with the 9 per cent rule, at least half of them will have to be parked in garages. The table below gives similar figures for different densities:\n\n| Cars per   | Per cent on Per cent in two   | Per cent in three   |               |\n|------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|---------------|\n| acre       | surface                       | story garages       | story garages |\n| 【2        | 100                           |                     |               |\n| 50         |                               |                     |               |\n| 17         | ટે ૦                           |                     |               |\n| 23         | 50                            | રે૦                  |               |\n| રે ૭        | ---                           | 100                 |               |\n\nWhat about underground parking? May we consider it as an exception to this rule? Only if it does not violate or restrict the use of the land above. If, for example, a parking garage is under a piece of land which was previously used as open space, with great trees growing on it, then the garage will almost certainly change the nature of the space above, because it will no longer be possible to grow large trees there. Such a parking garage is a violation of the land. Similarly, if the structural grid of the garage60 foot bays -- constrains the structural grid of the building above, so that this building is not free to express its needs, this is a violation too. Underground parking may be allowed only in those rare cases where it does not constrain the land above at all: under a major road, perhaps, or under a tennis court.\n\nWe see then, that the 9 per cent rule has colossal implications.\n\nSince underground parking will only rarely satisfy the conditions we have stated, the pattern really says that almost no part of the urban area may have more than 30 parking spaces per acre. This will create large changes in the central buriness district. Consider a part of a typical downtown area. There may be several hundred commuters per acre working there; and, under today's conditions, many of them park their cars in garages. But if it is true that there cannot be more than 30 parking spaces per acre, then either the work will be forced to decentralize, or the workers will have to rely on public transportation. It seems, in short, that this simple pattern, based on the social psychology of the environment, leads us to the same far reaching social conclusions as the patterns WEB OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION (16) and scattered work (9).\n\nTherefore:\nDo not allow more than 9 per cent of the land in any given area to be used for parking. In order to prevent the\n\"bunching\" of parking in huge neglected areas, it is necessary for a town or a community to subdivide its land into\n\"parking zones\" no larger than 10 acres each and to apply the same rule in each zone.\n\n![67_image_0.png](67_image_0.png)\n\n30 cars per acre maximum\n* * *\nTwo later patterns say that parking must take one of two forms:\ntiny, surface parking lots, or shielded parking structures-\n\nSHIELDED PARKING (97), SMALL PARKING LOTS (103). If you accept these patterns the 9 per cent rule will put an effective upper limit of 30 parking spaces per acre, on every part of the environment. Present-day on-street parking, with driveways, which provides spaces for about 35 cars per acre on the ground is ruled out. And those present-day high density business developments which depend on the car are also ruled out. . . .","embeddings":[null]},{"document":"A PATTERN LANGUAGE\nVolume 1, The Timeless Way of Building, and Volume\n2, 4 Patrern Language, are two halves of a single work.\nThis book provides a language, for building and plan-\nning; the other book provides the theory and instruc-\ntions for the use of the language. This book. describes the\ndetailed patterns for towns and neighborhoods, houses,\ngardens, and rooms. The other book explains the disci-\npline which makes it possible to use these patterns to\ncreate a building or a town. This book is the sourcebook of\nthe timeless way; the other is its practice and its origin.\nThe two books have evolved very much in parallel.\nThey have been growing over the last eight years, as\nwe have worked on the one hand to understand the\nnature of the building process, and on the other hand to\nconstruct an actual, possible pattern language. We have\nbeen forced by practical considerations, to publish these\ntwo books under separate covers; but in fact, they form\nan indivisible whole. It is possible to read them sepa-\nrately. But to gain the insight which we have tried to\ncommunicate in them, it is essential that you read them\nboth.\nThe Timeless Way of Building describes the funda-\nmental nature of the task of making towns and buildings.\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nIt is shown there, that towns and buildings will not be\nable to become alive, unless they are made by all the\npeople in society, and unless these people share a com-\nmon pattern language, within which to make these\nbuildings, and unless this cornmon pattern language is\nalive itself.\nTn this book, we present one possible pattern language,\nof the kind called for in The Timeless Way. This lan-\nguage is extremely practical. It is a language that we\nhave distilled from our own building and planning ef-\nforts over the last eight years. You can use it to work\nwith your neighbors, to improve your town and neighbor-\nhood. You can use it to design a house for yourself,\nwith your family; or to work with other people to de-\nsign an office or a workshop or a public building like a\nschool. And you can use it to guide you in the actual\nprocess of construction.\nThe elements of this language are entities called pat-\nterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs\nover and over again in our environment, and then\ndescribes the core of the solution to that problem, in such\na way that you can use this solution a million times over,\nwithout ever doing it the same way twice.\nFor convenience and clarity, each pattern has the same\nformat. First, there is a picture, which shows an arche-\ntypal example of that pattern. Second, after the picture,\neach pattern has an introductory paragraph, which sets\nthe context for the pattern, by explaining how it helps\nto complete certain larger patterns. Then there are three\ndiamonds to mark the beginning of the problem. After\nthe diamonds there is a headline, in bold type. This\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nheadline gives the essence of the problem in one or two\nsentences. After the headline comes the body of the\nproblem. This is the longest section. It describes the\nempirical background of the pattern, the evidence for its\nvalidity, the range of different ways the pattern can be\nmanifested in a building, and so on. Then, again in\nbold type, like the headline, is the solution—the heart\nof the pattern—which describes the field of physical and\nsocial relationships which are required to solve the stated\nproblem, in the stated context. This solution is always\nexactly what you need to do, to build the pattern. Then,\nafter the solution, there is a diagram, which shows the\nsolution in the form of a diagram, with labels to indicate\nits main components.\nAfter the diagram, another three diamonds, to show\nthat the main body of the pattern is finished. And finally,\nafter the diamonds there is a paragraph which ties the\npattern to all those smaller patterns in the language,\nwhich are needed to complete this pattern, to embellish\nit, to All it out.\nThere are two essential purposes behind this format.\nFirst, to present each pattern connected to other patterns,\nso that you grasp the collection of all 253 patterns as a\nwhole, as a language, within which you can create an in-\nfinite variety of combinations. Second, to present the\nproblem and solution of each pattern in such a way that\nyou can judge it for yourself, and modify it, without\nlosing the essence that is central to it.\nLet us next understand the nature of the connection\nbetween patterns.\nXI\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nThe patterns are ordered, beginning with the very\nlargest, for regions and towns, then working down\nthrough neighborhoods, clusters of buildings, buildings,\nrooms and alcoves, ending finally with details of con-\nstruction.\nThis order, which is presented as a straight linear\nsequerice, is essential to the way the language works. It is\npresented, and explained more fully, in the next section.\nWhat is most important about this sequence, is that it is\nbased on the connections between the patterns. Each\npattern is connected to certain “larger” patterns which\ncome above it in the language; and to certain “smaller”\npatterns which come below it in the language. The pat-\ntern helps to complete those larger patterns which are\n“above” it, and is itself completed by those smaller pat-\nterns which are “below” it.\nThus, for example, you will find that the pattern ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN (60), is connected first to certain larger\npatterns: SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY (13), IDENTIFIABLE\nNEIGHBORHOOD (14), WORK COMMUNITY (41), and\nquirr Backs (59). These appear on its first page. And it\nis also connected to certain smaller patterns: PosiTIVE\nOUTDOOR SPACE (107), TREE PLACES (171), and GARDEN\nWALL (173). These appear on its last page.\nWhat this means, is that IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBOR-\nHOOD, SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, WORK COMMUNITY, and\nQUIET BACKS are incomplete, unless they contain an ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN; and that an ACCESSIBLE GREEN is itself\nincomplete, unless it contains POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nAnd what it means in practical terms is that, if you\nx\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to lay out a green according to this pattern, you\nmust not only follow the instructions which describe the\npattern itself, but must also try to embed the green\nWithin an IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD or in some sUB-\nCULTURE BOUNDARY, and in a way that helps to form\nquizr Backs; and then you must work to complete the\ngreen by building in some posiTIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nIn short, no pattern is an isolated entity. Each pattern\ncan exist in the world, only to the extent that is sup-\nported by other patterns: the larger patterns in which it\nis embedded, the patterns of the same size that surround\nit, and the smaller patterns which are embedded in it.\nThis is a fundamental view of the world, It says that\nwhen you build a thing you cannot merely build that\nthing in isolation, but must also repair the world around\nit, and within it, so that the larger world at that one\nplace becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the\nthing which you make takes its place in the web of na-\nture, as you make it.\nNow we explain the nature of the relation between\nproblems and solutions, within the individual patterns.\nEach solution is stated in such a way that it gives the\nessential field of relationships needed to solve the prob-\nlem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you\ncan solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by\nadapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions\nat the place where you are making it.\nFor this reason, we have tried to write each solution\nin a way which imposes nothing on you. It contains only\nthose essentials which cannot be avoided if you really\nXU\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to solve the problem. In this sense, we have tried,\nin each solution, to capture the invariant property com-\nmon to all places which succeed in solving the problem.\nBut of course, we have not always succeeded. The\nsolutions we have given to these problems vary in signif-\ncance, Some are more true, more profound, more cer-\ntain, than others. To show this clearly we have marked\nevery pattern, in the text itself, with two asterisks, or one\nasterisk, or no asterisks.\nIn the patterns marked with two asterisks, we believe\nthat we have succeeded in stating a true invariant: in\nshort, that the solution we have stated summarizes a\nproperty common to all possible ways of solving the\nstated problem. In these two-asterisk cases we believe,\nin short, that it is not possible to solve the stated prob-\nlem properly, without shaping the environment in one\nway or another according to the pattern that we have\ngiven—and that, in these cases, the pattern describes\na deep and inescapable property of a well-formed en-\nvironment.\nIn the patterns marked with one asterisk, we believe\nthat we have made some progress towards identifying\nsuch an invariant: but that with careful work it will\ncertainly be possible to improve on the solution, In\nthese cases, we believe it would be wise for you to treat\nthe pattern with a certain amount of disrespect—and\nthat you seek out variants of the solution which we have\ngiven, since there are almost certainly possible ranges of\nsolutions which are not covered by what we have written.\nFinally, in the patterns without an asterisk, we are\ncertain that we have mot succeeded in defining a true\nx1V\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\ninvariant—that, on the contrary, there are certainly ways\nof solving the problem different from the one which we\nhave given. In these cases we have still stated a solution,\nin order to be concrete—to provide the reader with at\nleast one way of solving the problem-—but the task of\nfinding the true invariant, the true property which hes\nat the heart of all possible solutions to this problem, re-\nmains undone.\nWe hope, of course, that many of the people who\nread, and use this language, will try to improve these\npatterns—will put their energy to work, in this task of\nfinding more true, more profound invariants—and we\nhope that gradually these more true patterns, which are\nslowly discovered, as time goes on, will enter a common\nlanguage, which all of us can share.\nYou see then that the patterns are very much alive\nand evolving. In fact, if you like, each pattern may be\nlooked upon as a hypothesis like one of the hypotheses of\nscience. In this sense, each pattern represents our current\nbest guess as to what arrangement of the physical envi-\nronment will work to solve the problem presented. The\nempirical questions center on the problem—does it occur\nand is it felt in the way we have described it?—-and the\nsolution—-does the arrangement we propose in fact re-\nsolve the problem? And the asterisks represent our\ndegree of faith in these hypotheses. But of course, no\nmatter what the asterisks say, the patterns are still\nhypotheses, all 253 of them-—-and are therefore all\ntentative, all free to evolve under the impact of new\nexperience and observation.\nLet us finally explain the status of this language, why\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwe have called it “A Pattern Language” with the em-\nphasis on the word “A,” and how we imagine this pat-\ntern language might be related to the countless thou-\nsands of other languages we hope that people will make\nfor themselves, in the future.\nThe Timeless Way of Building says that every society\nwhich is alive and whole, will have its own unique and\ndistinct pattern language; and further, that every in-\ndividual in such a society will have a unique language,\nshared in part, but which as a totality is unique to the\nraind of the person who has it. In this sense, in a healthy\nsociety there will be as many pattern languages as there\nare people—even though these languages are shared and\nsimular,\nThe question then arises: What exactly is the status\nof this published language? In what frame of mind, and\nwith what intention, are we publishing this language\nhere? The fact that it is published as a book means that\nmany thousands of people can use it. Is it not true that\nthere is a danger that people might come to rely on this\none printed language, instead of developing their own\nlanguages, in their own minds?\nThe fact is, that we have written this book as a first\nstep in the society-wide process by which people will\ngradually become conscious of their own pattern lan-\nguages, and work to improve them. We believe, and\nhave explained in The Timeless Way of Building, that\nthe languages which people have today are so brutal, and\nso fragmented, that most people no longer have any\nlanguage to speak of at all—and what they do have is\nnot based on human, or natural considerations.\nXVI\n& PATTERN LANGUAGE\nWe have spent years trying to formulate this lan-\nguage, in the hope that when a person uses tt, he will\nbe so impressed by its power, and so joyful in its use,\nthat he will understand again, what it means to have a\nliving language of this kind. [If we only succeed in that,\nit is possible that each person may once again embark on\nthe construction and development of his own language—\nperhaps taking the language printed in this book, as a\npoint of departure.\nAnd yet, we do believe, of course, that this language\nwhich is printed here is something more than a manual,\nor a teacher, or a version of a possible pattern language.\nMany of the patterns here are archetypal—so deep, so\ndeeply rooted in the nature of things, that it seems likely\nthat they will be a part of human nature, and human ac-\ntion, as much in five hundred years, as they are today.\nWe doubt very much whether anyone could construct\na valid pattern language, in his own mind, which did\nnot include the pattern arcapes (119) for example, or\nthe pattern aLcoves (179).\nIn this sense, we have also tried to penetrate, as deep\nas we are able, into the nature of things in the environ-\nment: and hope that a great part of this language, which\nwe print here, will be a core of any sensible human pat-\ntern language, which any person constructs for himself,\nin his own mind. In this sense, at least a part of the\nlanguage we have presented here, is the archetypal core\nof all possible pattern languages, which can make people\nfeel alive and human.\nXVII\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nA pattern language has the structure of a network. This\nis explained fully in The Timeless Way of Bualdimg.\nHowever, when we use the network of a language, we\nalways use it as a sequence, going through the patterns,\nmoving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,\nalways from the ones which create structures, to the ones\nwhich then embellish those structures, and then to those\nwhich embellish the embellishments. . . .\nSince the language is in truth a network, there is no\none sequence which perfectly captures it. But the se-\nquence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the\nfull network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down,\ndips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little\nlike a needle following a tapestry.\nThe sequence of patterns is both a summary of the\nlanguage, and at the same time, an index to the patterns.\nIf you read through the sentences which connect the\ngroups of patterns to one another, you will get an over-\nview of the whole language. And once you get this over-\nview, you will then be able to find the patterns which\nare relevant to your own project.\nAnd finally, as we shall explain in the next section,\nthis sequence of patterns is also the “base map,” from\nKVL\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nwhich you can make a language for your own project,\nby choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,\nand leaving them more or less in the order that you\nfind them printed here.\nWe begin with that part of the language which defines\na town or community. These patterns can never be “de-\nsigned” or “buil?” in one fell swoop—but patient piece-\nmeal growth, designed in such a way that every indi-\nvidual act is always helping to create or generate these\nlarger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the\nyears, make a community that has these global patterns\nin tk.\nI.

They create\na coherent picture of an entire region, with the power\nto generate such regions in a million forms, with in-\nfinite variety in all the details.\nIt 1s also true that any small sequence of patterns from\nthis language is itself a language for a smaller part of\nthe environment; and this small list of patterns is then\ncapable of generating a million parks, paths, houses,\nworkshops, or gardens.\nFor example, consider the following ten patterns:\nPRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET (140)\nSUNNY PLACE (161)\nOUTDOOR ROOM (163)\nSIX-FOOT BALCONY (167)\nPATHS AND GOALS (120)\nCEILING HEIGHT VARIETY (190)\nCOLUMNS AT THE CORNERS (212)\nFRONT DOOR BENCH (242)\nRAISED FLOWERS (245)\nDIFFERENT CHAIRS (251)\nThis short list of patterns is itself a language: it is one\nof a thousand possible languages for a porch, at the front\nof a house, One of us chose this small language, to build\nAXERV\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBYJECT\na porch onto the front of his house. This is the way the\nlanguage, and its patterns, helped to generate this porch.\nI started with PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE sTREET (140). That\npattern calls for a terrace, slightly raised, connected to the house,\nand on the street side. suNNY PLACE (161) suggests that a special\nplace on the sunny side of the yard should be intensified and\nmade into a place by the use of a patio, balcony, outdoor room,\netc, | used these two patterns to locate a raised platform on the\nsouth side of the house.\nit half under the existing roof overhang, and kept a mature\npyracanthus tree right smack in the middle of the platform. The\noverhead foliage of the tree added to the roof-like enclosure of\nthe space. I put a wind screen of fixed glass on the west side of\nthe platform too, to give it even more enclosure.\nplatform. But this pattern had to be used judiciously and not\nblindly—the reasoning for the pattern has to do with the mini-\nmum space required for people to sit comfortably and carry on a\ndiscussion around a small side-table. Since 1 wanted space for at\nleast two of these conversation areas—one under the roof for very\nfeet square.\nNow PATHS AND Goats (120): Usually, this pattern deals with\nlarge paths in a neighborhood, and comes much earlier in a lan-\nguage. But I used it in a special way. It says that the paths which\nnaturally get formed by people’s walking, on the land, should be\npreserved and intensified. Since the path to our front door cut\nright across the corner of the place where 1 had planned to put\nthe platform, 1 cut the corner of the platform aff.\nThe height of the platform above the ground was determined\nby CEILING HEIGHT varieETY (190). By building the platform\napproximately one foot above the ground line, the ceiling height\nof the covered portion came out at between 6 and 7 feet——just\nright for a space as small as this. Since this height above the\nBOOR BENCH (242) was automatically satisfied.\nThere were three columns standing, supporting the roof over\nXXXVI]ground level is just about right for sitting, the pattern FRONT\nhot or rainy days, and one out under the sky for days when you\nwanted to be full in the sun, the balcony had to be made 12 x 12\nI used six-Foor BaLcony (167) to determine the size of the\nTo make this platform into an ovTsoor Room (163), I put\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nthe old porch, They had to stay where they are, because they hold\nthe roof up. But, following covumns ar THE coRNERs (212),\nthe platform was very carefully tailored to their positions—so that\nthe columns help define the social spaces on either side of them.\nFinally, we put a couple of flower boxes next to the “front door\nbench”—it’s nice to smell them when you sit there—according to\nRAISED FLowERs (245). And the old chairs you can see in the\nporch are DIeFERENT CHAIRS (251).\nYou can see, from this short example, how powerful\nand simple a pattern language is, And you are now,\nperhaps ready to appreciate how careful you must be,\nwhen you construct a language for yourself and your\nown project.\nThe character of the porch is given by the ten patterns\nin this short language. In just this way, each part of the\nenvironment is given its character by the collection of\npatterns which we choose to build into it. The character\nof what you build, will be given to it by the language of\npatterns you use, to generate it.\nXxxvii\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nFor this reason, of course, the task of choosing a lan-\nguage for your project is fundamental. The pattern lan-\nguage we have given here contains 253 patterns. You\ncan therefore use it to generate an almost unimaginably\nlarge number of possible different smaller languages,\nfor all the different projects you may choose to do,\nsimply by picking patterns from it.\nWe shall now describe a rough procedure by which\nyou can choose a language for your own project, first by\ntaking patterns from this language we have printed here,\nand then by adding patterns of your own.\nr. First of all, make a copy of the master sequence\n(pages xix-xxxiv) on which you can tick off the patterns\nwhich will form the language for your project. If you\ndon’t have access to a copying machine, you can tick off\npatterns in the list printed in the book, use paper clips\nto mark pages, write your own list, use paper markers—\nwhatever you like. But just for now, to explain it clearly,\nwe shall assume that you have a copy of the list in front\nof you.\n2. Scan down the list, and find the pattern which\nbest describes the overall scope of the project you have\nin mind, This is the starting pattern for your project.\nTick it. CIE there are two or three possible candidates,\ndon’t worry: just pick the one which seems best: the\nothers will fall in place as you move forward.)\n3. Turn to the starting pattern itself, in the book, and\nread it through. Notice that the other patterns men-\ntioned by name at the beginning and at the end, of the\npattern you are reading, are also possible candidates for\nyour language. The ones at the beginning will tend to be\n“larger” than your project. Don’t include them, unless\nXXXVI\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nyou have the power to help create these patterns, at least\nin a small way, in the world around your project. The\nones at the end are “smaller.” Almost all of them will\nbe important. Tick all of them, on your list, unless you\nhave some special reason for not wanting to include\nthem.\n4. Now your list has some more ticks on it. Turn to\nthe next highest pattern on the list which is ticked, and\nopen the book to that pattern. Once again, it will lead\nyou to other patterns. Once again, tick those which are\nrelevant—especially the ones which are “smaller” that\ncome at the end. As a general rule, do not tick the ones\nwhich are “larger” unless you can do something about\nthem, concretely, in your own project.\n5. When in doubt about a pattern, don’t include it.\nYour list can easily get too long: and if it does, it will\nbecome confusing. The list will be quite long enough,\neven if you only include the patterns you especially like.\n6. Keep going like this, until you have ticked all the\npatterns you want for your project.\n7. Now, adjust the sequence by adding your own ma-\nterial. If there are things you want to include in your\nproject, but you have not been able to find patterns which\ncorrespond to them, then write them in, at an appropri-\nate point in the sequence, near other patterns which are\nof about the same size and importance. For example,\nthere is no pattern for a sauna. If you want to include\none, write it in somewhere near BATHING ROOM (144)\nin your sequence.\n8. And of course, if you want to change any patterns,\nchange them. There are often cases where you may have\na personal version of a pattern, which is more true, or\nXXXIN\nCHOCSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nmore relevant for you. In this case, you will get the most\n“power” over the language, and make it your own most\neffectively, if you write the changes in, at the appropri-\nate places in the book. And, it will be most concrete of\nall, if you change the name of the pattern too—so that\nit captures your own changes clearly.\nyp oe\nSuppose now that you have a language for your proj-\nect. The way to use the language depends very much\non its scale. Patterns dealing with towns can only be\nimplemented gradually, by grass roots action; patterns\nfor a building can be built up in your mind, and marked\nout on the ground; patterns for construction must be\nbuilt physically, on the site. For this reason we have\ngiven three separate instructions, for these three different\nscales. For towns, see page 3; for buildings, see page\n463; for construction, see page 935.\nThe procedures for each of these three scales are de-\nscribed in much more detail with extensive examples,\nin the appropriate chapters of The Timeless Way of\nBuilding. For the town—see chapters 24 and 25; for an\nindividual building—see chapters 20, 21, and 22; and for\nthe process of construction which describes the way a\nbuilding is actually built see chapter 23.\nxh\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nFinally, a note of caution. This language, lke English,\ncan be a medium for prose, or a medium for poetry. The\ndifference between prose and poetry is not that different\nJanpuages are used, but that the same language is used,\ndifferently. In an ordinary English sentence, each word\nhas one meaning, and the sentence too, has one simple\nmeaning. In a poem, the meaning is far more dense.\nEach word carries several meanings; and the sentence\nas a Whole carries an enormous density of interlocking\nmeanings, which together illuminate the whole.\nThe same is true for pattern languages. It is possible\nto make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a\nrather loose way. A building made like this, is an as-\nsembly of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound.\nBut it 1s also possible to put patterns together in such a\nway that many many patterns overlap in the same\nphysical space: the building is very dense; it has many\nmeanings captured in a small space; and through this\ndensity, it becomes profound.\nIn a poern, this kind of density, creates illumination,\nby making identities between words, and meanings,\nwhose identity we have not understood before. In “O\nRose thou art sick,” the rose is identifed with many\nxii\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\ngreater, and more personal things than any rose—and\nthe poem illuminates the person, and the rose, because of\nthis connection. The connection not only illuminates the\nwords, but also illuminates our actual lives.\n© Rose thon art sick,\n‘The invisible worm,\nThat flies in the night\nin the howling storm:\nHas found out thy bed\nOF crimson joy:\nAnd his dark secret Jove\nDoes thy life destroy,\nWILLIAM BLAKE\nThe same exactly, happens in a building, Consider, for\nexample, the two patterns BATHING ROOM (144) and\nSTILL WATER (71). One defines a part of a house where\nyou can bathe yourself slowly, with pleasure, perhaps\nin company; a place to rest your limbs, and to relax. The\nother is a place in a neighborhood, where this is water\nto gaze into, perhaps to swim in, where children can sail\nboats, and splash about, which nourishes those parts of\nourselves which rely on water as one of the great\nelements of the unconscious.\nSuppose now, that we make a complex of buildings\nwhere individual bathing rooms are somehow connected\nto a common pond, or lake, or pool—where the bathing\nroom merges with this common place; where there is no\nsharp distinction between the individual and family pro-\ncesses of the bathing room, and the common pleasure\nof the common pool. In this place, these two patterns\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nexist in the same space; they are identified, there is a\ncompression of the two, which requires less space, and\nwhich is more profound than in a place where they are\nmerely side by side. The compression illuminates each\nof the patterns, sheds light on its meaning; and also i-\nluminates our lives, as we understand a little more about\nthe connections of our inner needs.\nBut this kind of compression is not only poetic and\nprofound. It is not only the stuff of poems and exotic\nstatements, but to some degree, the stuff of every English\nsentence. To some depree, there is compression in every\nsingle word we utter, just because each word carries the\nwhisper of the meanings of the words it is connected to.\nEven “Please pass the butter, Fred” has some compres-\nsion in it, because it carries overtones that lie in the con-\nnections of these words to all the words which came be-\nfore it.\nFach of us, talking to our friends, or to our families,\nmakes use of these compressions, which are drawn out\nfrom the connections between words which are given by\nthe language. The more we can feel all the connections\nin the language, the more rich and subtle are the things\nwe say at the most ordinary times.\nAnd once again, the same is true in building. The com-\npression of patterns into a single space, is not a poetic\nand exotic thing, kept for special buildings which are\nworks of art. It is the most ordinary economy of space. It\nis quite possible that all the patterns for a house might,\nin some form be present, and overlapping, in a simple\none-room cabin, The patterns do not need to be strung\nout, and kept separate. Every building, every room,\nxd\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nevery garden is better, when all the patterns which it\nneeds are compressed as far as it is possible for them to\nbe. The building will be cheaper; and the meanings in it\nwill be denser.\nIt is essential then, once you have learned to use the\nlanguage, that you pay attention to the possibility of\ncompressing the many patterns which you put together,\nin the smallest possible space. You may think of this\nprocess of compressing patterns, as a way to make the\ncheapest possible building which has the necessary pat-\nterns in it. It is, also, the only way of using a pattern\nlanguage to make buildings which are poems.\n","summary":"This chunk describes the pattern \"Parallel Roads\" which is part of a larger pattern language for designing towns and neighborhoods. It discusses the benefits of a system of parallel one-way roads to improve traffic flow and discourage short car trips, while preserving the quality of the local environment.","chunk":"# 23 Parallel Roads\n\n![69_Image_0.Png](69_Image_0.Png) Parallel Roads\n\n. . . in earlier patterns, we have proposed that cities should be subdivided into local transport areas, whose roads allow cars to move in and out from the ring roads, but strongly discourage internal movement across the area-Local TRANSPORT AREAS (II),\nRING ROADS (17)-and that these transport areas themselves be further subdivided into communities and neighborhoods, with the provision that all major roads are in the boundaries between communities and neighborhoods-subculture Boundary (13), NEIGHBORHOOD BOUNDARY (15). Now, what should the arrangement of these roads be like, to help the flow required by LOCAL\nTRANSPORT AREAS (II), and to maintain the boundaries?\n\nThe net-like pattern of streets is obsolete. Congestion is choking cities. Cars can average 60 miles per hour on freeways, but trips across town have an average speed of only 10 to 15 miles per hour.\n\nCertainly, in many cases, we want to get rid of cars, not help them to go faster. This is fully discussed in LOCAL TRANSPORT\nAREAS (II). But away from the areas where children play and people walk or use their bikes, there still need to be certain streets which carry cars. The question is: How can these streets be designed to carry the cars faster and without congestion!\n\nIt turns out that the loss of speed on present city streets is caused mainly by crossing movements: left-hand turns across traffic and four-way intersections. (G. F. Newell, \"The Effect of Left Turns on the Capacity of Traffic Intersection,\" Quarterly of Applied Mathematics, XVII, April 1959, pp. 67-76.)\nTo speed up traffic it is therefore necessary to create a network of major roads in which there are no four-way intersections, and no left-hand turns across traffic. This can easily be done if the major roads are alternating, one-way parallel roads, a few hundred feet apart, with smaller local roads opening off them, and the only connections between the parallel roads given by larger freeways crossing them at two- or three-mile intervals.\n\n## I 27\n\n![71_image_0.png](71_image_0.png)\n\nParallel roads.\nThis pattern has been discussed at considerable length in three papers (\"The Pattern of Streets,\" C. Alexander, AIF Journal, September 1966; Criticisms by D. Carson and P. Roosen-Runge, and Alexander's reply, in AIP Journal, September 1967.) We refer the reader to these original papers for the full derivation of all the geometric details. Our present statement is a radically condensed version. Here we concentrate mainly on one puzzling question-that of detours-because this is for many people the most surprising aspect of the full analysis.\n\nThe pattern of parallel roads-since it contains no major cross streets-creates many detours not present in today's net-like pattern. At first sight it seems likely that these detours will be impossibly large. However, in the papers mentioned above it is shown in detail that they are in fact perfectly reasonable. We summarize the argument below.\n\nIt is possible to calculate the probable detour for any trip of a given length through this proposed parallel road system as a function of the distance between the cross roads. Next, the probability of any given trip length may be obtained from actual studies of metropolitan auto trips. These two types of probabilities can finally be combined to yield an overall mean trip length and overall mean detours as shown below.\n\n| Trip Length, miles   | 】【                        |  2           | 3   | 4   | દ   | 7   | 10           | 4.12   |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------------|--------|\n| Proportion of        | (Overall Mean               |              |     |     |     |     |              |        |\n| 28                   |                             |              |     |     |     |     |              |        |\n| Trip Lengths %*      | x I                         | I I          | 9   | 9   | 24  | 8   | Trip Length) |        |\n| miles between        | Mean Detour, miles          | Overall Mean |     |     |     |     |              |        |\n| cross roads          | Detour                      |              |     |     |     |     |              |        |\n| I                    | .12 .05 .04 .03 .02 .01 .01 | .05          |     |     |     |     |              |        |\n| 2                    | .45 .24 .15 .11 .09 .07 .04 | .21          |     |     |     |     |              |        |\n| 3                    | .79 .58 .36 .25 .20 .15 .11 | .4 I         |     |     |     |     |              |        |\n\n* Data for distribution of trip lengths was obtained from Edward M. Hall, \"Travel Characteristics of Two San Diego Suburban Developments,\" Highway Research Board Bulletin 2039, Washington, D. C., 1958, pp. 1-19, Figure 11. These data are typical for metropolitan areas all over the Western world.\n\nWe see, therefore, that even with cross roads two miles apart, the lack of cross streets only increases trip lengths by 5 per cent.\n\nAt the same time, the average speed of trips will increase from 15 miles per hour to about 45 miles per hour, a threefold increase. The huge savings in time and fuel costs will more than offset the slight increase in distance.\n\nReferring back for a moment to the table of detours, it will be noticed that the highest detours occur for the shortest trips. We have argued elsewhere-LOCAL TRANSPORT AREAS (11)-that to preserve the quality of the city's environment it is necessary to discourage the use of the automobile for very short trips, and to encourage walking, bikes, buses, and horses instead. The pattern of parallel roads has precisely the feature which local transport areas need. It makes longer trips vastly more efficient, while discouraging the very short auto trips, and so provides the local transport area with just the internal structure which it needs to support its function.\n\nAlthough this pattern seems strange at first sight, it is in fact already happening in many parts of the world and has already proved its worth. For example, Berne, Switzerland, is one of the few cities in Europe that does not suffer from acute traffic congestion. When one looks at a map of Berne, one can see that its old center is formed by five long parallel roads with almost no cross streets. We believe that it has little congestion in the old center precisely because it contains the pattern. In many large cities today, the same insight is being implemented piecemeal-in the form of more and more one-way streets: in New York the alternating one-way Avenues, in downtown San Francisco the one-way major streets.\n\n![72_image_0.png](72_image_0.png)\n\nWithin a local transport area build no intersecting major roads at all; instead, build a system of parallel and alternating one-way roads to carry traffic to the RING ROADS\n(17). In existing towns, create this structure piecemeal, by gradually making major streets one-way and closing cross streets. Keep parallel roads at least 100 yards apart (to make room for neighborhoods between them) and no more than 300 or 400 yards apart.\n\n![73_image_0.png](73_image_0.png)\n\nThe parallel roads are the only through roads in a LOCAL\nTRANSPORT AREA (II). For access from the parallel roads to public buildings, house clusters, and individual houses use safe, slow, narrow roads which are not through roads-LOOPED LOCAL ROADS (49), GREEN STREETS (51)-and make their intersections with the parallel roads a \"T\"-T JUNCTION (50). Keep the pedestrian path system at right angles to the parallel roads, and raised above them where the two must run parallel-NETWORK OF PATHS\nAND CARS (52), RAISED WALK (55). Provide a ROAD CROSSING (54)\nwhere paths cross the parallel roads.\n","embeddings":[null]},{"document":"A PATTERN LANGUAGE\nVolume 1, The Timeless Way of Building, and Volume\n2, 4 Patrern Language, are two halves of a single work.\nThis book provides a language, for building and plan-\nning; the other book provides the theory and instruc-\ntions for the use of the language. This book. describes the\ndetailed patterns for towns and neighborhoods, houses,\ngardens, and rooms. The other book explains the disci-\npline which makes it possible to use these patterns to\ncreate a building or a town. This book is the sourcebook of\nthe timeless way; the other is its practice and its origin.\nThe two books have evolved very much in parallel.\nThey have been growing over the last eight years, as\nwe have worked on the one hand to understand the\nnature of the building process, and on the other hand to\nconstruct an actual, possible pattern language. We have\nbeen forced by practical considerations, to publish these\ntwo books under separate covers; but in fact, they form\nan indivisible whole. It is possible to read them sepa-\nrately. But to gain the insight which we have tried to\ncommunicate in them, it is essential that you read them\nboth.\nThe Timeless Way of Building describes the funda-\nmental nature of the task of making towns and buildings.\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nIt is shown there, that towns and buildings will not be\nable to become alive, unless they are made by all the\npeople in society, and unless these people share a com-\nmon pattern language, within which to make these\nbuildings, and unless this cornmon pattern language is\nalive itself.\nTn this book, we present one possible pattern language,\nof the kind called for in The Timeless Way. This lan-\nguage is extremely practical. It is a language that we\nhave distilled from our own building and planning ef-\nforts over the last eight years. You can use it to work\nwith your neighbors, to improve your town and neighbor-\nhood. You can use it to design a house for yourself,\nwith your family; or to work with other people to de-\nsign an office or a workshop or a public building like a\nschool. And you can use it to guide you in the actual\nprocess of construction.\nThe elements of this language are entities called pat-\nterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs\nover and over again in our environment, and then\ndescribes the core of the solution to that problem, in such\na way that you can use this solution a million times over,\nwithout ever doing it the same way twice.\nFor convenience and clarity, each pattern has the same\nformat. First, there is a picture, which shows an arche-\ntypal example of that pattern. Second, after the picture,\neach pattern has an introductory paragraph, which sets\nthe context for the pattern, by explaining how it helps\nto complete certain larger patterns. Then there are three\ndiamonds to mark the beginning of the problem. After\nthe diamonds there is a headline, in bold type. This\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nheadline gives the essence of the problem in one or two\nsentences. After the headline comes the body of the\nproblem. This is the longest section. It describes the\nempirical background of the pattern, the evidence for its\nvalidity, the range of different ways the pattern can be\nmanifested in a building, and so on. Then, again in\nbold type, like the headline, is the solution—the heart\nof the pattern—which describes the field of physical and\nsocial relationships which are required to solve the stated\nproblem, in the stated context. This solution is always\nexactly what you need to do, to build the pattern. Then,\nafter the solution, there is a diagram, which shows the\nsolution in the form of a diagram, with labels to indicate\nits main components.\nAfter the diagram, another three diamonds, to show\nthat the main body of the pattern is finished. And finally,\nafter the diamonds there is a paragraph which ties the\npattern to all those smaller patterns in the language,\nwhich are needed to complete this pattern, to embellish\nit, to All it out.\nThere are two essential purposes behind this format.\nFirst, to present each pattern connected to other patterns,\nso that you grasp the collection of all 253 patterns as a\nwhole, as a language, within which you can create an in-\nfinite variety of combinations. Second, to present the\nproblem and solution of each pattern in such a way that\nyou can judge it for yourself, and modify it, without\nlosing the essence that is central to it.\nLet us next understand the nature of the connection\nbetween patterns.\nXI\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nThe patterns are ordered, beginning with the very\nlargest, for regions and towns, then working down\nthrough neighborhoods, clusters of buildings, buildings,\nrooms and alcoves, ending finally with details of con-\nstruction.\nThis order, which is presented as a straight linear\nsequerice, is essential to the way the language works. It is\npresented, and explained more fully, in the next section.\nWhat is most important about this sequence, is that it is\nbased on the connections between the patterns. Each\npattern is connected to certain “larger” patterns which\ncome above it in the language; and to certain “smaller”\npatterns which come below it in the language. The pat-\ntern helps to complete those larger patterns which are\n“above” it, and is itself completed by those smaller pat-\nterns which are “below” it.\nThus, for example, you will find that the pattern ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN (60), is connected first to certain larger\npatterns: SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY (13), IDENTIFIABLE\nNEIGHBORHOOD (14), WORK COMMUNITY (41), and\nquirr Backs (59). These appear on its first page. And it\nis also connected to certain smaller patterns: PosiTIVE\nOUTDOOR SPACE (107), TREE PLACES (171), and GARDEN\nWALL (173). These appear on its last page.\nWhat this means, is that IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBOR-\nHOOD, SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, WORK COMMUNITY, and\nQUIET BACKS are incomplete, unless they contain an ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN; and that an ACCESSIBLE GREEN is itself\nincomplete, unless it contains POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nAnd what it means in practical terms is that, if you\nx\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to lay out a green according to this pattern, you\nmust not only follow the instructions which describe the\npattern itself, but must also try to embed the green\nWithin an IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD or in some sUB-\nCULTURE BOUNDARY, and in a way that helps to form\nquizr Backs; and then you must work to complete the\ngreen by building in some posiTIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nIn short, no pattern is an isolated entity. Each pattern\ncan exist in the world, only to the extent that is sup-\nported by other patterns: the larger patterns in which it\nis embedded, the patterns of the same size that surround\nit, and the smaller patterns which are embedded in it.\nThis is a fundamental view of the world, It says that\nwhen you build a thing you cannot merely build that\nthing in isolation, but must also repair the world around\nit, and within it, so that the larger world at that one\nplace becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the\nthing which you make takes its place in the web of na-\nture, as you make it.\nNow we explain the nature of the relation between\nproblems and solutions, within the individual patterns.\nEach solution is stated in such a way that it gives the\nessential field of relationships needed to solve the prob-\nlem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you\ncan solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by\nadapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions\nat the place where you are making it.\nFor this reason, we have tried to write each solution\nin a way which imposes nothing on you. It contains only\nthose essentials which cannot be avoided if you really\nXU\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to solve the problem. In this sense, we have tried,\nin each solution, to capture the invariant property com-\nmon to all places which succeed in solving the problem.\nBut of course, we have not always succeeded. The\nsolutions we have given to these problems vary in signif-\ncance, Some are more true, more profound, more cer-\ntain, than others. To show this clearly we have marked\nevery pattern, in the text itself, with two asterisks, or one\nasterisk, or no asterisks.\nIn the patterns marked with two asterisks, we believe\nthat we have succeeded in stating a true invariant: in\nshort, that the solution we have stated summarizes a\nproperty common to all possible ways of solving the\nstated problem. In these two-asterisk cases we believe,\nin short, that it is not possible to solve the stated prob-\nlem properly, without shaping the environment in one\nway or another according to the pattern that we have\ngiven—and that, in these cases, the pattern describes\na deep and inescapable property of a well-formed en-\nvironment.\nIn the patterns marked with one asterisk, we believe\nthat we have made some progress towards identifying\nsuch an invariant: but that with careful work it will\ncertainly be possible to improve on the solution, In\nthese cases, we believe it would be wise for you to treat\nthe pattern with a certain amount of disrespect—and\nthat you seek out variants of the solution which we have\ngiven, since there are almost certainly possible ranges of\nsolutions which are not covered by what we have written.\nFinally, in the patterns without an asterisk, we are\ncertain that we have mot succeeded in defining a true\nx1V\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\ninvariant—that, on the contrary, there are certainly ways\nof solving the problem different from the one which we\nhave given. In these cases we have still stated a solution,\nin order to be concrete—to provide the reader with at\nleast one way of solving the problem-—but the task of\nfinding the true invariant, the true property which hes\nat the heart of all possible solutions to this problem, re-\nmains undone.\nWe hope, of course, that many of the people who\nread, and use this language, will try to improve these\npatterns—will put their energy to work, in this task of\nfinding more true, more profound invariants—and we\nhope that gradually these more true patterns, which are\nslowly discovered, as time goes on, will enter a common\nlanguage, which all of us can share.\nYou see then that the patterns are very much alive\nand evolving. In fact, if you like, each pattern may be\nlooked upon as a hypothesis like one of the hypotheses of\nscience. In this sense, each pattern represents our current\nbest guess as to what arrangement of the physical envi-\nronment will work to solve the problem presented. The\nempirical questions center on the problem—does it occur\nand is it felt in the way we have described it?—-and the\nsolution—-does the arrangement we propose in fact re-\nsolve the problem? And the asterisks represent our\ndegree of faith in these hypotheses. But of course, no\nmatter what the asterisks say, the patterns are still\nhypotheses, all 253 of them-—-and are therefore all\ntentative, all free to evolve under the impact of new\nexperience and observation.\nLet us finally explain the status of this language, why\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwe have called it “A Pattern Language” with the em-\nphasis on the word “A,” and how we imagine this pat-\ntern language might be related to the countless thou-\nsands of other languages we hope that people will make\nfor themselves, in the future.\nThe Timeless Way of Building says that every society\nwhich is alive and whole, will have its own unique and\ndistinct pattern language; and further, that every in-\ndividual in such a society will have a unique language,\nshared in part, but which as a totality is unique to the\nraind of the person who has it. In this sense, in a healthy\nsociety there will be as many pattern languages as there\nare people—even though these languages are shared and\nsimular,\nThe question then arises: What exactly is the status\nof this published language? In what frame of mind, and\nwith what intention, are we publishing this language\nhere? The fact that it is published as a book means that\nmany thousands of people can use it. Is it not true that\nthere is a danger that people might come to rely on this\none printed language, instead of developing their own\nlanguages, in their own minds?\nThe fact is, that we have written this book as a first\nstep in the society-wide process by which people will\ngradually become conscious of their own pattern lan-\nguages, and work to improve them. We believe, and\nhave explained in The Timeless Way of Building, that\nthe languages which people have today are so brutal, and\nso fragmented, that most people no longer have any\nlanguage to speak of at all—and what they do have is\nnot based on human, or natural considerations.\nXVI\n& PATTERN LANGUAGE\nWe have spent years trying to formulate this lan-\nguage, in the hope that when a person uses tt, he will\nbe so impressed by its power, and so joyful in its use,\nthat he will understand again, what it means to have a\nliving language of this kind. [If we only succeed in that,\nit is possible that each person may once again embark on\nthe construction and development of his own language—\nperhaps taking the language printed in this book, as a\npoint of departure.\nAnd yet, we do believe, of course, that this language\nwhich is printed here is something more than a manual,\nor a teacher, or a version of a possible pattern language.\nMany of the patterns here are archetypal—so deep, so\ndeeply rooted in the nature of things, that it seems likely\nthat they will be a part of human nature, and human ac-\ntion, as much in five hundred years, as they are today.\nWe doubt very much whether anyone could construct\na valid pattern language, in his own mind, which did\nnot include the pattern arcapes (119) for example, or\nthe pattern aLcoves (179).\nIn this sense, we have also tried to penetrate, as deep\nas we are able, into the nature of things in the environ-\nment: and hope that a great part of this language, which\nwe print here, will be a core of any sensible human pat-\ntern language, which any person constructs for himself,\nin his own mind. In this sense, at least a part of the\nlanguage we have presented here, is the archetypal core\nof all possible pattern languages, which can make people\nfeel alive and human.\nXVII\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nA pattern language has the structure of a network. This\nis explained fully in The Timeless Way of Bualdimg.\nHowever, when we use the network of a language, we\nalways use it as a sequence, going through the patterns,\nmoving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,\nalways from the ones which create structures, to the ones\nwhich then embellish those structures, and then to those\nwhich embellish the embellishments. . . .\nSince the language is in truth a network, there is no\none sequence which perfectly captures it. But the se-\nquence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the\nfull network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down,\ndips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little\nlike a needle following a tapestry.\nThe sequence of patterns is both a summary of the\nlanguage, and at the same time, an index to the patterns.\nIf you read through the sentences which connect the\ngroups of patterns to one another, you will get an over-\nview of the whole language. And once you get this over-\nview, you will then be able to find the patterns which\nare relevant to your own project.\nAnd finally, as we shall explain in the next section,\nthis sequence of patterns is also the “base map,” from\nKVL\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nwhich you can make a language for your own project,\nby choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,\nand leaving them more or less in the order that you\nfind them printed here.\nWe begin with that part of the language which defines\na town or community. These patterns can never be “de-\nsigned” or “buil?” in one fell swoop—but patient piece-\nmeal growth, designed in such a way that every indi-\nvidual act is always helping to create or generate these\nlarger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the\nyears, make a community that has these global patterns\nin tk.\nI.

They create\na coherent picture of an entire region, with the power\nto generate such regions in a million forms, with in-\nfinite variety in all the details.\nIt 1s also true that any small sequence of patterns from\nthis language is itself a language for a smaller part of\nthe environment; and this small list of patterns is then\ncapable of generating a million parks, paths, houses,\nworkshops, or gardens.\nFor example, consider the following ten patterns:\nPRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET (140)\nSUNNY PLACE (161)\nOUTDOOR ROOM (163)\nSIX-FOOT BALCONY (167)\nPATHS AND GOALS (120)\nCEILING HEIGHT VARIETY (190)\nCOLUMNS AT THE CORNERS (212)\nFRONT DOOR BENCH (242)\nRAISED FLOWERS (245)\nDIFFERENT CHAIRS (251)\nThis short list of patterns is itself a language: it is one\nof a thousand possible languages for a porch, at the front\nof a house, One of us chose this small language, to build\nAXERV\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBYJECT\na porch onto the front of his house. This is the way the\nlanguage, and its patterns, helped to generate this porch.\nI started with PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE sTREET (140). That\npattern calls for a terrace, slightly raised, connected to the house,\nand on the street side. suNNY PLACE (161) suggests that a special\nplace on the sunny side of the yard should be intensified and\nmade into a place by the use of a patio, balcony, outdoor room,\netc, | used these two patterns to locate a raised platform on the\nsouth side of the house.\nit half under the existing roof overhang, and kept a mature\npyracanthus tree right smack in the middle of the platform. The\noverhead foliage of the tree added to the roof-like enclosure of\nthe space. I put a wind screen of fixed glass on the west side of\nthe platform too, to give it even more enclosure.\nplatform. But this pattern had to be used judiciously and not\nblindly—the reasoning for the pattern has to do with the mini-\nmum space required for people to sit comfortably and carry on a\ndiscussion around a small side-table. Since 1 wanted space for at\nleast two of these conversation areas—one under the roof for very\nfeet square.\nNow PATHS AND Goats (120): Usually, this pattern deals with\nlarge paths in a neighborhood, and comes much earlier in a lan-\nguage. But I used it in a special way. It says that the paths which\nnaturally get formed by people’s walking, on the land, should be\npreserved and intensified. Since the path to our front door cut\nright across the corner of the place where 1 had planned to put\nthe platform, 1 cut the corner of the platform aff.\nThe height of the platform above the ground was determined\nby CEILING HEIGHT varieETY (190). By building the platform\napproximately one foot above the ground line, the ceiling height\nof the covered portion came out at between 6 and 7 feet——just\nright for a space as small as this. Since this height above the\nBOOR BENCH (242) was automatically satisfied.\nThere were three columns standing, supporting the roof over\nXXXVI]ground level is just about right for sitting, the pattern FRONT\nhot or rainy days, and one out under the sky for days when you\nwanted to be full in the sun, the balcony had to be made 12 x 12\nI used six-Foor BaLcony (167) to determine the size of the\nTo make this platform into an ovTsoor Room (163), I put\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nthe old porch, They had to stay where they are, because they hold\nthe roof up. But, following covumns ar THE coRNERs (212),\nthe platform was very carefully tailored to their positions—so that\nthe columns help define the social spaces on either side of them.\nFinally, we put a couple of flower boxes next to the “front door\nbench”—it’s nice to smell them when you sit there—according to\nRAISED FLowERs (245). And the old chairs you can see in the\nporch are DIeFERENT CHAIRS (251).\nYou can see, from this short example, how powerful\nand simple a pattern language is, And you are now,\nperhaps ready to appreciate how careful you must be,\nwhen you construct a language for yourself and your\nown project.\nThe character of the porch is given by the ten patterns\nin this short language. In just this way, each part of the\nenvironment is given its character by the collection of\npatterns which we choose to build into it. The character\nof what you build, will be given to it by the language of\npatterns you use, to generate it.\nXxxvii\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nFor this reason, of course, the task of choosing a lan-\nguage for your project is fundamental. The pattern lan-\nguage we have given here contains 253 patterns. You\ncan therefore use it to generate an almost unimaginably\nlarge number of possible different smaller languages,\nfor all the different projects you may choose to do,\nsimply by picking patterns from it.\nWe shall now describe a rough procedure by which\nyou can choose a language for your own project, first by\ntaking patterns from this language we have printed here,\nand then by adding patterns of your own.\nr. First of all, make a copy of the master sequence\n(pages xix-xxxiv) on which you can tick off the patterns\nwhich will form the language for your project. If you\ndon’t have access to a copying machine, you can tick off\npatterns in the list printed in the book, use paper clips\nto mark pages, write your own list, use paper markers—\nwhatever you like. But just for now, to explain it clearly,\nwe shall assume that you have a copy of the list in front\nof you.\n2. Scan down the list, and find the pattern which\nbest describes the overall scope of the project you have\nin mind, This is the starting pattern for your project.\nTick it. CIE there are two or three possible candidates,\ndon’t worry: just pick the one which seems best: the\nothers will fall in place as you move forward.)\n3. Turn to the starting pattern itself, in the book, and\nread it through. Notice that the other patterns men-\ntioned by name at the beginning and at the end, of the\npattern you are reading, are also possible candidates for\nyour language. The ones at the beginning will tend to be\n“larger” than your project. Don’t include them, unless\nXXXVI\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nyou have the power to help create these patterns, at least\nin a small way, in the world around your project. The\nones at the end are “smaller.” Almost all of them will\nbe important. Tick all of them, on your list, unless you\nhave some special reason for not wanting to include\nthem.\n4. Now your list has some more ticks on it. Turn to\nthe next highest pattern on the list which is ticked, and\nopen the book to that pattern. Once again, it will lead\nyou to other patterns. Once again, tick those which are\nrelevant—especially the ones which are “smaller” that\ncome at the end. As a general rule, do not tick the ones\nwhich are “larger” unless you can do something about\nthem, concretely, in your own project.\n5. When in doubt about a pattern, don’t include it.\nYour list can easily get too long: and if it does, it will\nbecome confusing. The list will be quite long enough,\neven if you only include the patterns you especially like.\n6. Keep going like this, until you have ticked all the\npatterns you want for your project.\n7. Now, adjust the sequence by adding your own ma-\nterial. If there are things you want to include in your\nproject, but you have not been able to find patterns which\ncorrespond to them, then write them in, at an appropri-\nate point in the sequence, near other patterns which are\nof about the same size and importance. For example,\nthere is no pattern for a sauna. If you want to include\none, write it in somewhere near BATHING ROOM (144)\nin your sequence.\n8. And of course, if you want to change any patterns,\nchange them. There are often cases where you may have\na personal version of a pattern, which is more true, or\nXXXIN\nCHOCSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nmore relevant for you. In this case, you will get the most\n“power” over the language, and make it your own most\neffectively, if you write the changes in, at the appropri-\nate places in the book. And, it will be most concrete of\nall, if you change the name of the pattern too—so that\nit captures your own changes clearly.\nyp oe\nSuppose now that you have a language for your proj-\nect. The way to use the language depends very much\non its scale. Patterns dealing with towns can only be\nimplemented gradually, by grass roots action; patterns\nfor a building can be built up in your mind, and marked\nout on the ground; patterns for construction must be\nbuilt physically, on the site. For this reason we have\ngiven three separate instructions, for these three different\nscales. For towns, see page 3; for buildings, see page\n463; for construction, see page 935.\nThe procedures for each of these three scales are de-\nscribed in much more detail with extensive examples,\nin the appropriate chapters of The Timeless Way of\nBuilding. For the town—see chapters 24 and 25; for an\nindividual building—see chapters 20, 21, and 22; and for\nthe process of construction which describes the way a\nbuilding is actually built see chapter 23.\nxh\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nFinally, a note of caution. This language, lke English,\ncan be a medium for prose, or a medium for poetry. The\ndifference between prose and poetry is not that different\nJanpuages are used, but that the same language is used,\ndifferently. In an ordinary English sentence, each word\nhas one meaning, and the sentence too, has one simple\nmeaning. In a poem, the meaning is far more dense.\nEach word carries several meanings; and the sentence\nas a Whole carries an enormous density of interlocking\nmeanings, which together illuminate the whole.\nThe same is true for pattern languages. It is possible\nto make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a\nrather loose way. A building made like this, is an as-\nsembly of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound.\nBut it 1s also possible to put patterns together in such a\nway that many many patterns overlap in the same\nphysical space: the building is very dense; it has many\nmeanings captured in a small space; and through this\ndensity, it becomes profound.\nIn a poern, this kind of density, creates illumination,\nby making identities between words, and meanings,\nwhose identity we have not understood before. In “O\nRose thou art sick,” the rose is identifed with many\nxii\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\ngreater, and more personal things than any rose—and\nthe poem illuminates the person, and the rose, because of\nthis connection. The connection not only illuminates the\nwords, but also illuminates our actual lives.\n© Rose thon art sick,\n‘The invisible worm,\nThat flies in the night\nin the howling storm:\nHas found out thy bed\nOF crimson joy:\nAnd his dark secret Jove\nDoes thy life destroy,\nWILLIAM BLAKE\nThe same exactly, happens in a building, Consider, for\nexample, the two patterns BATHING ROOM (144) and\nSTILL WATER (71). One defines a part of a house where\nyou can bathe yourself slowly, with pleasure, perhaps\nin company; a place to rest your limbs, and to relax. The\nother is a place in a neighborhood, where this is water\nto gaze into, perhaps to swim in, where children can sail\nboats, and splash about, which nourishes those parts of\nourselves which rely on water as one of the great\nelements of the unconscious.\nSuppose now, that we make a complex of buildings\nwhere individual bathing rooms are somehow connected\nto a common pond, or lake, or pool—where the bathing\nroom merges with this common place; where there is no\nsharp distinction between the individual and family pro-\ncesses of the bathing room, and the common pleasure\nof the common pool. In this place, these two patterns\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nexist in the same space; they are identified, there is a\ncompression of the two, which requires less space, and\nwhich is more profound than in a place where they are\nmerely side by side. The compression illuminates each\nof the patterns, sheds light on its meaning; and also i-\nluminates our lives, as we understand a little more about\nthe connections of our inner needs.\nBut this kind of compression is not only poetic and\nprofound. It is not only the stuff of poems and exotic\nstatements, but to some degree, the stuff of every English\nsentence. To some depree, there is compression in every\nsingle word we utter, just because each word carries the\nwhisper of the meanings of the words it is connected to.\nEven “Please pass the butter, Fred” has some compres-\nsion in it, because it carries overtones that lie in the con-\nnections of these words to all the words which came be-\nfore it.\nFach of us, talking to our friends, or to our families,\nmakes use of these compressions, which are drawn out\nfrom the connections between words which are given by\nthe language. The more we can feel all the connections\nin the language, the more rich and subtle are the things\nwe say at the most ordinary times.\nAnd once again, the same is true in building. The com-\npression of patterns into a single space, is not a poetic\nand exotic thing, kept for special buildings which are\nworks of art. It is the most ordinary economy of space. It\nis quite possible that all the patterns for a house might,\nin some form be present, and overlapping, in a simple\none-room cabin, The patterns do not need to be strung\nout, and kept separate. Every building, every room,\nxd\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nevery garden is better, when all the patterns which it\nneeds are compressed as far as it is possible for them to\nbe. The building will be cheaper; and the meanings in it\nwill be denser.\nIt is essential then, once you have learned to use the\nlanguage, that you pay attention to the possibility of\ncompressing the many patterns which you put together,\nin the smallest possible space. You may think of this\nprocess of compressing patterns, as a way to make the\ncheapest possible building which has the necessary pat-\nterns in it. It is, also, the only way of using a pattern\nlanguage to make buildings which are poems.\n","summary":"This chunk discusses the pattern \"Local Transport Areas\" and how it relates to the larger patterns of community and neighborhood structure within a city, as described in the book \"A Pattern Language\".","chunk":"# 11 Local Transport Areas**\n\n![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)\n\n. . . superimposed over the MOSAIC OF SUBCULTURES (8), there is a need for a still larger cellular structure: the local transport areas. These areas, 1-2 miles across, not only help to form subcultures, by creating natural boundaries in the city, but they can also help to generate the individual city fingers in the cirry COUNTRY FINGERS (3), and they can help to circumscribe each downtown area too, as a special self-contained area of local transportation-MACIC of THE CITY (10).\n\nCars give people wonderful freedom and increase their opportunities. But they also destroy the environment, to an extent so drastic that they kill all social life.\n\nThe value and power of the car have proved so great that it seems impossible to imagine a future without some form of private, high-speed vehicle. Who will willingly give up the degree of freedom provided by cars? At the same time, it is undeniably true that cars turn towns to mincemeat. Somehow local areas must be saved from the pressure of cars or their future equivalents.\n\nIt is possible to solve the problem as soon as we make a distinction between short trips and long trips. Cars are not very good for short trips inside a town, and it is on these trips that they do their greatest damage. But they are good for fairly long trips, where they cause less damage. The problem will be solved if towns are divided up into areas about one mile across, with the idea that cars may be used for trips which leave these areas, but that other, slower forms of transportation will be used for all.\n\ntrips inside these areas-foot, bike, horse, taxi. All it needs, physically, is a street pattern that discourages people from using private cars for trips within these areas, and encourages the use:\nof walking, bikes, horses, and taxis instead-but allows the use:\nof cars for trips which leave the area.\n\nLet us start with a list of the obvious social problems created by the car:\nAir pollution\n\nNoise Danger Ill health Congestion Parking problem Eyesore The first two are very serious, but are not inherent in the car; they could both be solved, for instance, by an electric car. They are, in that sense, temporary problems. Danger will be a persistent feature of the car so long as we go on using high-speed vehicles for local trips. The widespread lack of exercise and consequent ill health created by the use of motor-driven vehicles will persist unless offset by an amount of daily exercise at least equal to a 20 minute walk per day. And finally, the problems of congestion and loss of speed, difficulty and cost of parking, and eyesore are all direct results of the fact that the car is a very large vehicle which consumes a great deal of space.\n\nThe fact that cars are large is, in the end, the most serious aspect of a transportation system based on the use of cars, since it is inherent in the very nature of cars. Let us state this problem in its most pungent form. A man occupies about 5 square feet of space when he is standing still, and perhaps 10 square feet when he is walking. A car occupies about 350 square feet when it is tanding still (if we include access), and at 30 miles an hour, when cars are 3 car lengths apart, it occupies about 1000 square feet. As we know, most of the time cars have a single occupant.\n\nThis means that when people use cars, each person occupies almost 100 times as much space as he does when he is a pedestrian.\n\nIf each person driving occupies an area 100 times as large as he does when he is on his feet, this means that people are 10 times as far apart. In other svords, the use of cars has the overall effect of spreading people out, and keeping them apart.\n\nThe effect of this particular feature of cars on the social fabric is clear. People are drawn away from each other; densities and corresponding frequencies of interaction decrease substantially.\n\nContacts become fragmented and specialized, since they are localized by the nature of the interaction into well-defined indoor places-the home, the workplace, and maybe the homes of a few isolated friends.\n\n## ર્ રે\n\nIt is quite possible that the collective cohesion people need to form a viable society just cannot develop when the vehicles which people use force them to be 10 times farther apart, on the average, than they have to be. This states the possible social cost of cars in its strongest form. It may be that cars cause the breakdown of society, simply because of their geometry.\n\nAt the same time that cars cause all these difficulties, they also have certain unprecedented virtues, which have in fact led to their enormous success. These virtues are:\nFlexibility Privacy Door-to-door trips, without transfer Immediacy These virtues are particularly important in a metropolitan region which is essentially two-dimensional. Public transportation can provide very fast, frequent, door-to-door service, along certain atteries. But in the widely spread out, two-dimensional character of a modern urban region, public transportation by itself cannot compete successfully with cars. Even in cities like London and Paris, with the finest urban public transportation in the world, the trains and buses have fewer riders every year because people are switching to cars. They are willing to put up with all the delays, congestion, and parking costs, because apparently the convenience and privacy of the car are more valuable.\n\nUnder theoretical analysis of this situation, the only kind of transportation system which meets all the needs is a system of individual vehicles, which can use certain high-speed lines for long cross-city trips and which can use their own power when they leave the public lines in local areas. The systems which come closest to this theoretical model are the various Private Rapid Transit proposals; one example is the Westinghouse Starrcar-a system in which tiny two-man vehicles drive on streets locally and onto high-speed public rails for long trips.\n\nHowever, the Starrcar-type systems have a number of disadvantages. They make relatively little contribution to the problem of space. The small cars, though smaller than a conventional car, still take up vastly more space than a person. Since the private cars will not be capable of long cross-country trips, they must be\n\ntreated as a \"second vehicle\"-and are rather expensive. They make no contribution to the health problem, since people are still sitting motionless while they travel. The system is relatively antisocial, since people are still encapsulated in \"bubbles\" while they travel. It is highly idealistic, since it works if everyone has a Starrear, but makes no allowance for the great variety of movement which people actually desire, i.e., bikes, horses, jalopies, old classic cars, family buses.\n\nWe propose a system which has the advantages of the Starrcar system but which is more realistic, easier to implement, and, we believe, better adapted to people's needs. The essence of the system lies in the following two propositions:\nI. For local trips, people use a variety of low-speed, low-cost vehicles (bicycles, tricycles, scooters, golf carts, bicycle buggies, horses, etc.), which take up less room than cars and which all leave their passengers in closer touch with their environment and with one another.\n\n![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)\n\nMany ways of getting around on local trips.\n2. People still own, and use, cars and trucks-but mainly for long trips. We assume that these cars can be made to be quiet, nonpolluting, and simple to repair, and that people simply consider them best suited for long distance travel. It will still be possible for people to use a car or a truck for a local trip, cither in a case of emergency, or for some special convenience. However, the town is constructed in such a way that it is actually expensive and inconvenient to use cars for local trips-so that people only do it when they are willing to pay for the very great social costs of doing so.\n\nBreak the urban area down into local transport areas, each one between I and 2 miles across, surrounded by a ring road. Within the local transport area, build minor local roads and paths for internal movements on foot, by bike, on horseback, and in local vehicles; build major roads which make it easy for cars and trucks to get to and from the ring roads, but place them to make internal local trips slow and inconvenient.\n\n![11_image_0.png](11_image_0.png)\n\n0 4 4\nTo keep main roads for long distance traffic, but not for internal local traffic, lay them out as parallel one way roads, and keep these parallel roads away from the center of the area, so that they are very good for getting to the ring roads, but inconvenient for short local trips-PARAI.LEL ROADS (23). Lay out abundant footpaths and bike paths and green streets, at right angles to the main roads, and make these paths for local traffic go directly through the center-GREEN STREETS (51), NETWORK OF PATHS AND CARS\n(52), BIKE PATHS AND RACKS (56); sink the ring roads around the outside of each area, or shield the noise they make some other way -- RING ROADS (17) ; keep parking to a minimum within the area, and keep all major parking garages near the ring roads-\nNINE PER CENT PARKING (22), SHIELDED PARKING (97); and build a major interchange within the center of the area-INTER-\nchange (34). . . .\n\nbuild up these larger city patterns from the grass roots, through action essentially controlled by two levels of self-governing communities, which exist as physically identifiable places; 12.  COMMUNITY OF 7000 13. SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY\nI 4.  IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD\n15.  NEIGHBORHOOD BOUNDARY\n\n12 COMMUNITY OF 7000*\n\n![13_image_0.png](13_image_0.png)\n\n. . . the MOSAIC OF SUBCULTURES (8) is made up of a great number of large and small self-governing communities and neighborhoods. Community of 7000 helps define the structure of the large communities.\n\nIndividuals have no effective voice in any community of more than 5000-10,000 persons.\n\nPeople can only have a genuine effect on local government when the units of local government are autonomous, self-governing, self-budgeting communities, which are small enough to create the possibility of an immediate link between the man in the street and his local officials and elected representatives.\n\nThis is an old idea. It was the model for Athenian democracy in the third and fourth centuries B.C .; it was Jefferson's plan for American democracy; it was the tack Confucius took in his book on government, The Great Digest.\n\nFor these people, the practice of exercising power over local matters was itself an experience of intrinsic satisfaction. Sophocles wrote that life would be unbearable were it not for the freedom to initiate action in a small community. And it was considered that this experience was not only good in itself, but was the only way of governing that would not lead to corruption. Jefferson wanted to spread out the power not because \"the people\" were so bright and clever, but precisely because they were prone to error, and it was therefore dangerous to vest power in the hands of a few who would inevitably make big mistakes. \"Break the country into wards\" was his campaign slogan, so that the mistakes will be manageable and people will get practice and improve.\n\nToday the distance between people and the centers of power that govern them is vast-both psychologically and geographically. Milton Kotler, a Jeffersonian, has described the experience:\nThe process of city administration is invisible to the citizen who sees little evidence of its human components but feels the sharp pain of taxation. With increasingly poor public service, his desires and needs are more insistently expressed. Yet his expressions of need seem .\n\nto issue into thin air, for government does not appear attentive to his demands. This disjunction between citizen and government is the major political problem of city government, because it embodies the dynamics of civil disorder. . . . (Milton Kotler, Neighborhood Foundations, Memorandum \\#24; \"Neighborhood corporations and the reorganization of city government,\" unpub. ms., August 1967.)\nThere are two ways in which the physical environment, as it is now ordered, promotes and sustains the separation between citizens and their government. First, the size of the political community is so large that its members are separated from its leaders simply by their number. Second, government is invisible, physically located out of the realm of most citizens' daily lives. Unless these two conditions are altered, political alienation is not likely to be overcome.\n\nI. The size of the political community. It is obvious that the larger the community the greater the distance between the average citizen and the heads of government. Paul Goodman has proposed a rule of thumb, based on cities like Athens in their prime, that no citizen be more than two friends away from the highest member of the local unit. Assume that everyone knows about 12 people in his local community. Using this notion and Goodman's rule we can see that an optimum size for a political community would be about 128 or 1728 households or 5500 persons. This figure corresponds to an old Chicago school estimate of 5000. And it is the same order of magnitude as the size of ECCO,\nthe neighborhood corporation in Columbus, Ohio, of 6000 to 7000, described by Kotler (Committee on Government Operations, U.S. Senate, 89th Congress, Second Session, Part 9, December 1966).\n\nThe editors of The Ecologist have a similar intuition about the proper size for units of local government. (See their Blueprint for Sureival, Penguin Books, 1972, pp. 50-55.) And Terence Lee, in his study, \"Urban neighborhood as a socio-spatial schema,\" Ekistics 177, August 1970, gives evidence for the importance of the spatial community. Lee gives 75 acres as a natural size for a community. At 25 persons per acre, such a community would accommodate some 2000 persons; at 60 persons per acre, some 4500.\n\n2. The visible location of local government. Even when local\n\nbranches of government are decentralized in function, they are often still centralized in space, hidden in vast municipal citycounty buildings out of the realm of everyday life. These places are intimidating and alienating. What is needed is for every person to feel at home in the place of his local government with his ideas and complaints. A person must feel that it is a forum, that it is his directly, that he can call and talk to the person in charge of such and such, and see him personally within a day or two.\n\nFor this purpose, local forums must be situated in highly visible and accessible places. They could, for instance, be located in the most active marketplace of each community of 5000 to 7000. We discuss this possibility more fully under LOCAL TOWN HALL\n(44), but we emphasize it here, since the provision of a political\n\"heart,\" a political center of gravity, is an essential part of a political community.\n\n![16_image_0.png](16_image_0.png)\n\nCommunity meeting of several thousand.\n\nTherefore:\nDecentralize city governments in a way that gives local control to communities of 5,000 to 10,000 persons. As nearly as possible, use natural geographic and historical boundaries to mark these communities. Give each community the power to initiate, decide, and execute the affairs that con-\n\ncern it closely: land use, housing, maintenance, streets, parks, police, schooling, welfare, neighborhood services.\n\n![17_image_0.png](17_image_0.png)\n\ncontrol of local taxes\n\n## 10 4 4\n\nSeparate the communities from one another by means of substantial areas-suBCULTURE BOUNDARY (13); subdivide each community into 10 or 20 independent neighborhoods, each with a representative on the community council-IDENTIFIABLE\nNEIGHBORHOOD (14); provide a central place where people have a chance to come together-ECCENTRIC NUCLEUs (28), PROM-\nENADE (31); and in this central place provide a local town hall, as a focal point for the community's political activity-LOCAL\nTOWN HALL (44). . . .\n","embeddings":[null]},{"document":"A PATTERN LANGUAGE\nVolume 1, The Timeless Way of Building, and Volume\n2, 4 Patrern Language, are two halves of a single work.\nThis book provides a language, for building and plan-\nning; the other book provides the theory and instruc-\ntions for the use of the language. This book. describes the\ndetailed patterns for towns and neighborhoods, houses,\ngardens, and rooms. The other book explains the disci-\npline which makes it possible to use these patterns to\ncreate a building or a town. This book is the sourcebook of\nthe timeless way; the other is its practice and its origin.\nThe two books have evolved very much in parallel.\nThey have been growing over the last eight years, as\nwe have worked on the one hand to understand the\nnature of the building process, and on the other hand to\nconstruct an actual, possible pattern language. We have\nbeen forced by practical considerations, to publish these\ntwo books under separate covers; but in fact, they form\nan indivisible whole. It is possible to read them sepa-\nrately. But to gain the insight which we have tried to\ncommunicate in them, it is essential that you read them\nboth.\nThe Timeless Way of Building describes the funda-\nmental nature of the task of making towns and buildings.\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nIt is shown there, that towns and buildings will not be\nable to become alive, unless they are made by all the\npeople in society, and unless these people share a com-\nmon pattern language, within which to make these\nbuildings, and unless this cornmon pattern language is\nalive itself.\nTn this book, we present one possible pattern language,\nof the kind called for in The Timeless Way. This lan-\nguage is extremely practical. It is a language that we\nhave distilled from our own building and planning ef-\nforts over the last eight years. You can use it to work\nwith your neighbors, to improve your town and neighbor-\nhood. You can use it to design a house for yourself,\nwith your family; or to work with other people to de-\nsign an office or a workshop or a public building like a\nschool. And you can use it to guide you in the actual\nprocess of construction.\nThe elements of this language are entities called pat-\nterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs\nover and over again in our environment, and then\ndescribes the core of the solution to that problem, in such\na way that you can use this solution a million times over,\nwithout ever doing it the same way twice.\nFor convenience and clarity, each pattern has the same\nformat. First, there is a picture, which shows an arche-\ntypal example of that pattern. Second, after the picture,\neach pattern has an introductory paragraph, which sets\nthe context for the pattern, by explaining how it helps\nto complete certain larger patterns. Then there are three\ndiamonds to mark the beginning of the problem. After\nthe diamonds there is a headline, in bold type. This\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nheadline gives the essence of the problem in one or two\nsentences. After the headline comes the body of the\nproblem. This is the longest section. It describes the\nempirical background of the pattern, the evidence for its\nvalidity, the range of different ways the pattern can be\nmanifested in a building, and so on. Then, again in\nbold type, like the headline, is the solution—the heart\nof the pattern—which describes the field of physical and\nsocial relationships which are required to solve the stated\nproblem, in the stated context. This solution is always\nexactly what you need to do, to build the pattern. Then,\nafter the solution, there is a diagram, which shows the\nsolution in the form of a diagram, with labels to indicate\nits main components.\nAfter the diagram, another three diamonds, to show\nthat the main body of the pattern is finished. And finally,\nafter the diamonds there is a paragraph which ties the\npattern to all those smaller patterns in the language,\nwhich are needed to complete this pattern, to embellish\nit, to All it out.\nThere are two essential purposes behind this format.\nFirst, to present each pattern connected to other patterns,\nso that you grasp the collection of all 253 patterns as a\nwhole, as a language, within which you can create an in-\nfinite variety of combinations. Second, to present the\nproblem and solution of each pattern in such a way that\nyou can judge it for yourself, and modify it, without\nlosing the essence that is central to it.\nLet us next understand the nature of the connection\nbetween patterns.\nXI\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nThe patterns are ordered, beginning with the very\nlargest, for regions and towns, then working down\nthrough neighborhoods, clusters of buildings, buildings,\nrooms and alcoves, ending finally with details of con-\nstruction.\nThis order, which is presented as a straight linear\nsequerice, is essential to the way the language works. It is\npresented, and explained more fully, in the next section.\nWhat is most important about this sequence, is that it is\nbased on the connections between the patterns. Each\npattern is connected to certain “larger” patterns which\ncome above it in the language; and to certain “smaller”\npatterns which come below it in the language. The pat-\ntern helps to complete those larger patterns which are\n“above” it, and is itself completed by those smaller pat-\nterns which are “below” it.\nThus, for example, you will find that the pattern ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN (60), is connected first to certain larger\npatterns: SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY (13), IDENTIFIABLE\nNEIGHBORHOOD (14), WORK COMMUNITY (41), and\nquirr Backs (59). These appear on its first page. And it\nis also connected to certain smaller patterns: PosiTIVE\nOUTDOOR SPACE (107), TREE PLACES (171), and GARDEN\nWALL (173). These appear on its last page.\nWhat this means, is that IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBOR-\nHOOD, SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, WORK COMMUNITY, and\nQUIET BACKS are incomplete, unless they contain an ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN; and that an ACCESSIBLE GREEN is itself\nincomplete, unless it contains POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nAnd what it means in practical terms is that, if you\nx\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to lay out a green according to this pattern, you\nmust not only follow the instructions which describe the\npattern itself, but must also try to embed the green\nWithin an IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD or in some sUB-\nCULTURE BOUNDARY, and in a way that helps to form\nquizr Backs; and then you must work to complete the\ngreen by building in some posiTIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nIn short, no pattern is an isolated entity. Each pattern\ncan exist in the world, only to the extent that is sup-\nported by other patterns: the larger patterns in which it\nis embedded, the patterns of the same size that surround\nit, and the smaller patterns which are embedded in it.\nThis is a fundamental view of the world, It says that\nwhen you build a thing you cannot merely build that\nthing in isolation, but must also repair the world around\nit, and within it, so that the larger world at that one\nplace becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the\nthing which you make takes its place in the web of na-\nture, as you make it.\nNow we explain the nature of the relation between\nproblems and solutions, within the individual patterns.\nEach solution is stated in such a way that it gives the\nessential field of relationships needed to solve the prob-\nlem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you\ncan solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by\nadapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions\nat the place where you are making it.\nFor this reason, we have tried to write each solution\nin a way which imposes nothing on you. It contains only\nthose essentials which cannot be avoided if you really\nXU\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to solve the problem. In this sense, we have tried,\nin each solution, to capture the invariant property com-\nmon to all places which succeed in solving the problem.\nBut of course, we have not always succeeded. The\nsolutions we have given to these problems vary in signif-\ncance, Some are more true, more profound, more cer-\ntain, than others. To show this clearly we have marked\nevery pattern, in the text itself, with two asterisks, or one\nasterisk, or no asterisks.\nIn the patterns marked with two asterisks, we believe\nthat we have succeeded in stating a true invariant: in\nshort, that the solution we have stated summarizes a\nproperty common to all possible ways of solving the\nstated problem. In these two-asterisk cases we believe,\nin short, that it is not possible to solve the stated prob-\nlem properly, without shaping the environment in one\nway or another according to the pattern that we have\ngiven—and that, in these cases, the pattern describes\na deep and inescapable property of a well-formed en-\nvironment.\nIn the patterns marked with one asterisk, we believe\nthat we have made some progress towards identifying\nsuch an invariant: but that with careful work it will\ncertainly be possible to improve on the solution, In\nthese cases, we believe it would be wise for you to treat\nthe pattern with a certain amount of disrespect—and\nthat you seek out variants of the solution which we have\ngiven, since there are almost certainly possible ranges of\nsolutions which are not covered by what we have written.\nFinally, in the patterns without an asterisk, we are\ncertain that we have mot succeeded in defining a true\nx1V\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\ninvariant—that, on the contrary, there are certainly ways\nof solving the problem different from the one which we\nhave given. In these cases we have still stated a solution,\nin order to be concrete—to provide the reader with at\nleast one way of solving the problem-—but the task of\nfinding the true invariant, the true property which hes\nat the heart of all possible solutions to this problem, re-\nmains undone.\nWe hope, of course, that many of the people who\nread, and use this language, will try to improve these\npatterns—will put their energy to work, in this task of\nfinding more true, more profound invariants—and we\nhope that gradually these more true patterns, which are\nslowly discovered, as time goes on, will enter a common\nlanguage, which all of us can share.\nYou see then that the patterns are very much alive\nand evolving. In fact, if you like, each pattern may be\nlooked upon as a hypothesis like one of the hypotheses of\nscience. In this sense, each pattern represents our current\nbest guess as to what arrangement of the physical envi-\nronment will work to solve the problem presented. The\nempirical questions center on the problem—does it occur\nand is it felt in the way we have described it?—-and the\nsolution—-does the arrangement we propose in fact re-\nsolve the problem? And the asterisks represent our\ndegree of faith in these hypotheses. But of course, no\nmatter what the asterisks say, the patterns are still\nhypotheses, all 253 of them-—-and are therefore all\ntentative, all free to evolve under the impact of new\nexperience and observation.\nLet us finally explain the status of this language, why\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwe have called it “A Pattern Language” with the em-\nphasis on the word “A,” and how we imagine this pat-\ntern language might be related to the countless thou-\nsands of other languages we hope that people will make\nfor themselves, in the future.\nThe Timeless Way of Building says that every society\nwhich is alive and whole, will have its own unique and\ndistinct pattern language; and further, that every in-\ndividual in such a society will have a unique language,\nshared in part, but which as a totality is unique to the\nraind of the person who has it. In this sense, in a healthy\nsociety there will be as many pattern languages as there\nare people—even though these languages are shared and\nsimular,\nThe question then arises: What exactly is the status\nof this published language? In what frame of mind, and\nwith what intention, are we publishing this language\nhere? The fact that it is published as a book means that\nmany thousands of people can use it. Is it not true that\nthere is a danger that people might come to rely on this\none printed language, instead of developing their own\nlanguages, in their own minds?\nThe fact is, that we have written this book as a first\nstep in the society-wide process by which people will\ngradually become conscious of their own pattern lan-\nguages, and work to improve them. We believe, and\nhave explained in The Timeless Way of Building, that\nthe languages which people have today are so brutal, and\nso fragmented, that most people no longer have any\nlanguage to speak of at all—and what they do have is\nnot based on human, or natural considerations.\nXVI\n& PATTERN LANGUAGE\nWe have spent years trying to formulate this lan-\nguage, in the hope that when a person uses tt, he will\nbe so impressed by its power, and so joyful in its use,\nthat he will understand again, what it means to have a\nliving language of this kind. [If we only succeed in that,\nit is possible that each person may once again embark on\nthe construction and development of his own language—\nperhaps taking the language printed in this book, as a\npoint of departure.\nAnd yet, we do believe, of course, that this language\nwhich is printed here is something more than a manual,\nor a teacher, or a version of a possible pattern language.\nMany of the patterns here are archetypal—so deep, so\ndeeply rooted in the nature of things, that it seems likely\nthat they will be a part of human nature, and human ac-\ntion, as much in five hundred years, as they are today.\nWe doubt very much whether anyone could construct\na valid pattern language, in his own mind, which did\nnot include the pattern arcapes (119) for example, or\nthe pattern aLcoves (179).\nIn this sense, we have also tried to penetrate, as deep\nas we are able, into the nature of things in the environ-\nment: and hope that a great part of this language, which\nwe print here, will be a core of any sensible human pat-\ntern language, which any person constructs for himself,\nin his own mind. In this sense, at least a part of the\nlanguage we have presented here, is the archetypal core\nof all possible pattern languages, which can make people\nfeel alive and human.\nXVII\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nA pattern language has the structure of a network. This\nis explained fully in The Timeless Way of Bualdimg.\nHowever, when we use the network of a language, we\nalways use it as a sequence, going through the patterns,\nmoving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,\nalways from the ones which create structures, to the ones\nwhich then embellish those structures, and then to those\nwhich embellish the embellishments. . . .\nSince the language is in truth a network, there is no\none sequence which perfectly captures it. But the se-\nquence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the\nfull network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down,\ndips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little\nlike a needle following a tapestry.\nThe sequence of patterns is both a summary of the\nlanguage, and at the same time, an index to the patterns.\nIf you read through the sentences which connect the\ngroups of patterns to one another, you will get an over-\nview of the whole language. And once you get this over-\nview, you will then be able to find the patterns which\nare relevant to your own project.\nAnd finally, as we shall explain in the next section,\nthis sequence of patterns is also the “base map,” from\nKVL\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nwhich you can make a language for your own project,\nby choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,\nand leaving them more or less in the order that you\nfind them printed here.\nWe begin with that part of the language which defines\na town or community. These patterns can never be “de-\nsigned” or “buil?” in one fell swoop—but patient piece-\nmeal growth, designed in such a way that every indi-\nvidual act is always helping to create or generate these\nlarger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the\nyears, make a community that has these global patterns\nin tk.\nI.

They create\na coherent picture of an entire region, with the power\nto generate such regions in a million forms, with in-\nfinite variety in all the details.\nIt 1s also true that any small sequence of patterns from\nthis language is itself a language for a smaller part of\nthe environment; and this small list of patterns is then\ncapable of generating a million parks, paths, houses,\nworkshops, or gardens.\nFor example, consider the following ten patterns:\nPRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET (140)\nSUNNY PLACE (161)\nOUTDOOR ROOM (163)\nSIX-FOOT BALCONY (167)\nPATHS AND GOALS (120)\nCEILING HEIGHT VARIETY (190)\nCOLUMNS AT THE CORNERS (212)\nFRONT DOOR BENCH (242)\nRAISED FLOWERS (245)\nDIFFERENT CHAIRS (251)\nThis short list of patterns is itself a language: it is one\nof a thousand possible languages for a porch, at the front\nof a house, One of us chose this small language, to build\nAXERV\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBYJECT\na porch onto the front of his house. This is the way the\nlanguage, and its patterns, helped to generate this porch.\nI started with PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE sTREET (140). That\npattern calls for a terrace, slightly raised, connected to the house,\nand on the street side. suNNY PLACE (161) suggests that a special\nplace on the sunny side of the yard should be intensified and\nmade into a place by the use of a patio, balcony, outdoor room,\netc, | used these two patterns to locate a raised platform on the\nsouth side of the house.\nit half under the existing roof overhang, and kept a mature\npyracanthus tree right smack in the middle of the platform. The\noverhead foliage of the tree added to the roof-like enclosure of\nthe space. I put a wind screen of fixed glass on the west side of\nthe platform too, to give it even more enclosure.\nplatform. But this pattern had to be used judiciously and not\nblindly—the reasoning for the pattern has to do with the mini-\nmum space required for people to sit comfortably and carry on a\ndiscussion around a small side-table. Since 1 wanted space for at\nleast two of these conversation areas—one under the roof for very\nfeet square.\nNow PATHS AND Goats (120): Usually, this pattern deals with\nlarge paths in a neighborhood, and comes much earlier in a lan-\nguage. But I used it in a special way. It says that the paths which\nnaturally get formed by people’s walking, on the land, should be\npreserved and intensified. Since the path to our front door cut\nright across the corner of the place where 1 had planned to put\nthe platform, 1 cut the corner of the platform aff.\nThe height of the platform above the ground was determined\nby CEILING HEIGHT varieETY (190). By building the platform\napproximately one foot above the ground line, the ceiling height\nof the covered portion came out at between 6 and 7 feet——just\nright for a space as small as this. Since this height above the\nBOOR BENCH (242) was automatically satisfied.\nThere were three columns standing, supporting the roof over\nXXXVI]ground level is just about right for sitting, the pattern FRONT\nhot or rainy days, and one out under the sky for days when you\nwanted to be full in the sun, the balcony had to be made 12 x 12\nI used six-Foor BaLcony (167) to determine the size of the\nTo make this platform into an ovTsoor Room (163), I put\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nthe old porch, They had to stay where they are, because they hold\nthe roof up. But, following covumns ar THE coRNERs (212),\nthe platform was very carefully tailored to their positions—so that\nthe columns help define the social spaces on either side of them.\nFinally, we put a couple of flower boxes next to the “front door\nbench”—it’s nice to smell them when you sit there—according to\nRAISED FLowERs (245). And the old chairs you can see in the\nporch are DIeFERENT CHAIRS (251).\nYou can see, from this short example, how powerful\nand simple a pattern language is, And you are now,\nperhaps ready to appreciate how careful you must be,\nwhen you construct a language for yourself and your\nown project.\nThe character of the porch is given by the ten patterns\nin this short language. In just this way, each part of the\nenvironment is given its character by the collection of\npatterns which we choose to build into it. The character\nof what you build, will be given to it by the language of\npatterns you use, to generate it.\nXxxvii\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nFor this reason, of course, the task of choosing a lan-\nguage for your project is fundamental. The pattern lan-\nguage we have given here contains 253 patterns. You\ncan therefore use it to generate an almost unimaginably\nlarge number of possible different smaller languages,\nfor all the different projects you may choose to do,\nsimply by picking patterns from it.\nWe shall now describe a rough procedure by which\nyou can choose a language for your own project, first by\ntaking patterns from this language we have printed here,\nand then by adding patterns of your own.\nr. First of all, make a copy of the master sequence\n(pages xix-xxxiv) on which you can tick off the patterns\nwhich will form the language for your project. If you\ndon’t have access to a copying machine, you can tick off\npatterns in the list printed in the book, use paper clips\nto mark pages, write your own list, use paper markers—\nwhatever you like. But just for now, to explain it clearly,\nwe shall assume that you have a copy of the list in front\nof you.\n2. Scan down the list, and find the pattern which\nbest describes the overall scope of the project you have\nin mind, This is the starting pattern for your project.\nTick it. CIE there are two or three possible candidates,\ndon’t worry: just pick the one which seems best: the\nothers will fall in place as you move forward.)\n3. Turn to the starting pattern itself, in the book, and\nread it through. Notice that the other patterns men-\ntioned by name at the beginning and at the end, of the\npattern you are reading, are also possible candidates for\nyour language. The ones at the beginning will tend to be\n“larger” than your project. Don’t include them, unless\nXXXVI\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nyou have the power to help create these patterns, at least\nin a small way, in the world around your project. The\nones at the end are “smaller.” Almost all of them will\nbe important. Tick all of them, on your list, unless you\nhave some special reason for not wanting to include\nthem.\n4. Now your list has some more ticks on it. Turn to\nthe next highest pattern on the list which is ticked, and\nopen the book to that pattern. Once again, it will lead\nyou to other patterns. Once again, tick those which are\nrelevant—especially the ones which are “smaller” that\ncome at the end. As a general rule, do not tick the ones\nwhich are “larger” unless you can do something about\nthem, concretely, in your own project.\n5. When in doubt about a pattern, don’t include it.\nYour list can easily get too long: and if it does, it will\nbecome confusing. The list will be quite long enough,\neven if you only include the patterns you especially like.\n6. Keep going like this, until you have ticked all the\npatterns you want for your project.\n7. Now, adjust the sequence by adding your own ma-\nterial. If there are things you want to include in your\nproject, but you have not been able to find patterns which\ncorrespond to them, then write them in, at an appropri-\nate point in the sequence, near other patterns which are\nof about the same size and importance. For example,\nthere is no pattern for a sauna. If you want to include\none, write it in somewhere near BATHING ROOM (144)\nin your sequence.\n8. And of course, if you want to change any patterns,\nchange them. There are often cases where you may have\na personal version of a pattern, which is more true, or\nXXXIN\nCHOCSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nmore relevant for you. In this case, you will get the most\n“power” over the language, and make it your own most\neffectively, if you write the changes in, at the appropri-\nate places in the book. And, it will be most concrete of\nall, if you change the name of the pattern too—so that\nit captures your own changes clearly.\nyp oe\nSuppose now that you have a language for your proj-\nect. The way to use the language depends very much\non its scale. Patterns dealing with towns can only be\nimplemented gradually, by grass roots action; patterns\nfor a building can be built up in your mind, and marked\nout on the ground; patterns for construction must be\nbuilt physically, on the site. For this reason we have\ngiven three separate instructions, for these three different\nscales. For towns, see page 3; for buildings, see page\n463; for construction, see page 935.\nThe procedures for each of these three scales are de-\nscribed in much more detail with extensive examples,\nin the appropriate chapters of The Timeless Way of\nBuilding. For the town—see chapters 24 and 25; for an\nindividual building—see chapters 20, 21, and 22; and for\nthe process of construction which describes the way a\nbuilding is actually built see chapter 23.\nxh\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nFinally, a note of caution. This language, lke English,\ncan be a medium for prose, or a medium for poetry. The\ndifference between prose and poetry is not that different\nJanpuages are used, but that the same language is used,\ndifferently. In an ordinary English sentence, each word\nhas one meaning, and the sentence too, has one simple\nmeaning. In a poem, the meaning is far more dense.\nEach word carries several meanings; and the sentence\nas a Whole carries an enormous density of interlocking\nmeanings, which together illuminate the whole.\nThe same is true for pattern languages. It is possible\nto make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a\nrather loose way. A building made like this, is an as-\nsembly of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound.\nBut it 1s also possible to put patterns together in such a\nway that many many patterns overlap in the same\nphysical space: the building is very dense; it has many\nmeanings captured in a small space; and through this\ndensity, it becomes profound.\nIn a poern, this kind of density, creates illumination,\nby making identities between words, and meanings,\nwhose identity we have not understood before. In “O\nRose thou art sick,” the rose is identifed with many\nxii\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\ngreater, and more personal things than any rose—and\nthe poem illuminates the person, and the rose, because of\nthis connection. The connection not only illuminates the\nwords, but also illuminates our actual lives.\n© Rose thon art sick,\n‘The invisible worm,\nThat flies in the night\nin the howling storm:\nHas found out thy bed\nOF crimson joy:\nAnd his dark secret Jove\nDoes thy life destroy,\nWILLIAM BLAKE\nThe same exactly, happens in a building, Consider, for\nexample, the two patterns BATHING ROOM (144) and\nSTILL WATER (71). One defines a part of a house where\nyou can bathe yourself slowly, with pleasure, perhaps\nin company; a place to rest your limbs, and to relax. The\nother is a place in a neighborhood, where this is water\nto gaze into, perhaps to swim in, where children can sail\nboats, and splash about, which nourishes those parts of\nourselves which rely on water as one of the great\nelements of the unconscious.\nSuppose now, that we make a complex of buildings\nwhere individual bathing rooms are somehow connected\nto a common pond, or lake, or pool—where the bathing\nroom merges with this common place; where there is no\nsharp distinction between the individual and family pro-\ncesses of the bathing room, and the common pleasure\nof the common pool. In this place, these two patterns\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nexist in the same space; they are identified, there is a\ncompression of the two, which requires less space, and\nwhich is more profound than in a place where they are\nmerely side by side. The compression illuminates each\nof the patterns, sheds light on its meaning; and also i-\nluminates our lives, as we understand a little more about\nthe connections of our inner needs.\nBut this kind of compression is not only poetic and\nprofound. It is not only the stuff of poems and exotic\nstatements, but to some degree, the stuff of every English\nsentence. To some depree, there is compression in every\nsingle word we utter, just because each word carries the\nwhisper of the meanings of the words it is connected to.\nEven “Please pass the butter, Fred” has some compres-\nsion in it, because it carries overtones that lie in the con-\nnections of these words to all the words which came be-\nfore it.\nFach of us, talking to our friends, or to our families,\nmakes use of these compressions, which are drawn out\nfrom the connections between words which are given by\nthe language. The more we can feel all the connections\nin the language, the more rich and subtle are the things\nwe say at the most ordinary times.\nAnd once again, the same is true in building. The com-\npression of patterns into a single space, is not a poetic\nand exotic thing, kept for special buildings which are\nworks of art. It is the most ordinary economy of space. It\nis quite possible that all the patterns for a house might,\nin some form be present, and overlapping, in a simple\none-room cabin, The patterns do not need to be strung\nout, and kept separate. Every building, every room,\nxd\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nevery garden is better, when all the patterns which it\nneeds are compressed as far as it is possible for them to\nbe. The building will be cheaper; and the meanings in it\nwill be denser.\nIt is essential then, once you have learned to use the\nlanguage, that you pay attention to the possibility of\ncompressing the many patterns which you put together,\nin the smallest possible space. You may think of this\nprocess of compressing patterns, as a way to make the\ncheapest possible building which has the necessary pat-\nterns in it. It is, also, the only way of using a pattern\nlanguage to make buildings which are poems.\n","summary":"This chunk describes the pattern \"Eccentric Nucleus\" which is part of the larger pattern language for designing towns and communities. It provides guidelines for how to encourage the growth and accumulation of density to form a clear configuration of peaks and valleys within a community.","chunk":"# Eccentric Nucleus\n\n4. Even though the center lies on one side of the community, forming a boundary of the community, we may also assume that the center does need to bulge into the community just a little.\n\nThis follows from the fact that, even though services do need to be in the boundary of the community, not in its middle, still, people do have some need for the psychological center of their community to be at least somewhere toward the geometric center of gravity. If we make the boundary bulge toward the geometric center, then this axis will naturally form a center-and, further, its catch basin, according to the data given above, will correspond almost perfectly with the community.\n\n![96_image_0.png](96_image_0.png)\n\nThe inward bulge.\n5. Finally, although we know that the center needs to be mainly in the boundary, we do not know exactly just how large it needs to be. At the edge of the city, where the overall density is low-the center will be small. At the center of the city, where the overall density is higher, it will be larger, because the greater density of population supports more services. In both cases, it will be in the boundary. If it is too large to be contained at one point, it will naturally extend itself along the boundary, but still within the boundary, thus forming a lune, a partial horseshoe, long or short, according to its position in the greater city.\n\nA partial horseshoe.\n\n![96_image_1.png](96_image_1.png)\n\n## I\n\nThese rules are rather simple. If we follow them, we shall find a beautiful gradient of overlapping imbricated horseshoes, not unlike the scales of a fish. If the city gradually gets this highly coherent structure, then we can be sure that the articulation of dense areas, and areas of little density, will be so clear that both activity and quiet can exist, each intense, unmixed, and each.\n\navailable to everyone.\n\nTherefore:\nEncourage growth and the accumulation of density to form a clear configuration of peaks and valleys according to the following rules:\nI. Consider the town as a collection of communities of 7000. These communities will be between 1/4 mile:\nacross and 2 miles across, according to their overall density.\n\n2. Mark that point in the boundary of each community which is closest to the nearest major urban center. This point will be the peak of the density, and the core of the \"eccentric\" nucleus.\n\n3. Allow the high density to bulge in from the boundary, toward the center of gravity of the community, thus enlarging the eccentric nucleus toward the center.\n\n4. Continue this high density to form a ridge around.\n\nthe boundary in horseshoe fashion-with the length. of the horseshoe dependent on the overall mean gross density, at that part of the city, and the bulge of the horseshoe toward the center of the region, so that the horseshoes form a gradient, according to their position in the region.

This book. describes the\ndetailed patterns for towns and neighborhoods, houses,\ngardens, and rooms. The other book explains the disci-\npline which makes it possible to use these patterns to\ncreate a building or a town. This book is the sourcebook of\nthe timeless way; the other is its practice and its origin.\nThe two books have evolved very much in parallel.\nThey have been growing over the last eight years, as\nwe have worked on the one hand to understand the\nnature of the building process, and on the other hand to\nconstruct an actual, possible pattern language. We have\nbeen forced by practical considerations, to publish these\ntwo books under separate covers; but in fact, they form\nan indivisible whole. It is possible to read them sepa-\nrately. But to gain the insight which we have tried to\ncommunicate in them, it is essential that you read them\nboth.\nThe Timeless Way of Building describes the funda-\nmental nature of the task of making towns and buildings.\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nIt is shown there, that towns and buildings will not be\nable to become alive, unless they are made by all the\npeople in society, and unless these people share a com-\nmon pattern language, within which to make these\nbuildings, and unless this cornmon pattern language is\nalive itself.\nTn this book, we present one possible pattern language,\nof the kind called for in The Timeless Way. This lan-\nguage is extremely practical. It is a language that we\nhave distilled from our own building and planning ef-\nforts over the last eight years. You can use it to work\nwith your neighbors, to improve your town and neighbor-\nhood. You can use it to design a house for yourself,\nwith your family; or to work with other people to de-\nsign an office or a workshop or a public building like a\nschool. And you can use it to guide you in the actual\nprocess of construction.\nThe elements of this language are entities called pat-\nterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs\nover and over again in our environment, and then\ndescribes the core of the solution to that problem, in such\na way that you can use this solution a million times over,\nwithout ever doing it the same way twice.\nFor convenience and clarity, each pattern has the same\nformat. First, there is a picture, which shows an arche-\ntypal example of that pattern. Second, after the picture,\neach pattern has an introductory paragraph, which sets\nthe context for the pattern, by explaining how it helps\nto complete certain larger patterns. Then there are three\ndiamonds to mark the beginning of the problem. After\nthe diamonds there is a headline, in bold type. This\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nheadline gives the essence of the problem in one or two\nsentences. After the headline comes the body of the\nproblem. This is the longest section. It describes the\nempirical background of the pattern, the evidence for its\nvalidity, the range of different ways the pattern can be\nmanifested in a building, and so on. Then, again in\nbold type, like the headline, is the solution—the heart\nof the pattern—which describes the field of physical and\nsocial relationships which are required to solve the stated\nproblem, in the stated context. This solution is always\nexactly what you need to do, to build the pattern. Then,\nafter the solution, there is a diagram, which shows the\nsolution in the form of a diagram, with labels to indicate\nits main components.\nAfter the diagram, another three diamonds, to show\nthat the main body of the pattern is finished. And finally,\nafter the diamonds there is a paragraph which ties the\npattern to all those smaller patterns in the language,\nwhich are needed to complete this pattern, to embellish\nit, to All it out.\nThere are two essential purposes behind this format.\nFirst, to present each pattern connected to other patterns,\nso that you grasp the collection of all 253 patterns as a\nwhole, as a language, within which you can create an in-\nfinite variety of combinations. Second, to present the\nproblem and solution of each pattern in such a way that\nyou can judge it for yourself, and modify it, without\nlosing the essence that is central to it.\nLet us next understand the nature of the connection\nbetween patterns.\nXI\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nThe patterns are ordered, beginning with the very\nlargest, for regions and towns, then working down\nthrough neighborhoods, clusters of buildings, buildings,\nrooms and alcoves, ending finally with details of con-\nstruction.\nThis order, which is presented as a straight linear\nsequerice, is essential to the way the language works. It is\npresented, and explained more fully, in the next section.\nWhat is most important about this sequence, is that it is\nbased on the connections between the patterns. Each\npattern is connected to certain “larger” patterns which\ncome above it in the language; and to certain “smaller”\npatterns which come below it in the language. The pat-\ntern helps to complete those larger patterns which are\n“above” it, and is itself completed by those smaller pat-\nterns which are “below” it.\nThus, for example, you will find that the pattern ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN (60), is connected first to certain larger\npatterns: SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY (13), IDENTIFIABLE\nNEIGHBORHOOD (14), WORK COMMUNITY (41), and\nquirr Backs (59). These appear on its first page. And it\nis also connected to certain smaller patterns: PosiTIVE\nOUTDOOR SPACE (107), TREE PLACES (171), and GARDEN\nWALL (173). These appear on its last page.\nWhat this means, is that IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBOR-\nHOOD, SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, WORK COMMUNITY, and\nQUIET BACKS are incomplete, unless they contain an ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN; and that an ACCESSIBLE GREEN is itself\nincomplete, unless it contains POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nAnd what it means in practical terms is that, if you\nx\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to lay out a green according to this pattern, you\nmust not only follow the instructions which describe the\npattern itself, but must also try to embed the green\nWithin an IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD or in some sUB-\nCULTURE BOUNDARY, and in a way that helps to form\nquizr Backs; and then you must work to complete the\ngreen by building in some posiTIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nIn short, no pattern is an isolated entity. Each pattern\ncan exist in the world, only to the extent that is sup-\nported by other patterns: the larger patterns in which it\nis embedded, the patterns of the same size that surround\nit, and the smaller patterns which are embedded in it.\nThis is a fundamental view of the world, It says that\nwhen you build a thing you cannot merely build that\nthing in isolation, but must also repair the world around\nit, and within it, so that the larger world at that one\nplace becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the\nthing which you make takes its place in the web of na-\nture, as you make it.\nNow we explain the nature of the relation between\nproblems and solutions, within the individual patterns.\nEach solution is stated in such a way that it gives the\nessential field of relationships needed to solve the prob-\nlem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you\ncan solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by\nadapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions\nat the place where you are making it.\nFor this reason, we have tried to write each solution\nin a way which imposes nothing on you. It contains only\nthose essentials which cannot be avoided if you really\nXU\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to solve the problem. In this sense, we have tried,\nin each solution, to capture the invariant property com-\nmon to all places which succeed in solving the problem.\nBut of course, we have not always succeeded. The\nsolutions we have given to these problems vary in signif-\ncance, Some are more true, more profound, more cer-\ntain, than others. To show this clearly we have marked\nevery pattern, in the text itself, with two asterisks, or one\nasterisk, or no asterisks.\nIn the patterns marked with two asterisks, we believe\nthat we have succeeded in stating a true invariant: in\nshort, that the solution we have stated summarizes a\nproperty common to all possible ways of solving the\nstated problem. In these two-asterisk cases we believe,\nin short, that it is not possible to solve the stated prob-\nlem properly, without shaping the environment in one\nway or another according to the pattern that we have\ngiven—and that, in these cases, the pattern describes\na deep and inescapable property of a well-formed en-\nvironment.\nIn the patterns marked with one asterisk, we believe\nthat we have made some progress towards identifying\nsuch an invariant: but that with careful work it will\ncertainly be possible to improve on the solution, In\nthese cases, we believe it would be wise for you to treat\nthe pattern with a certain amount of disrespect—and\nthat you seek out variants of the solution which we have\ngiven, since there are almost certainly possible ranges of\nsolutions which are not covered by what we have written.\nFinally, in the patterns without an asterisk, we are\ncertain that we have mot succeeded in defining a true\nx1V\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\ninvariant—that, on the contrary, there are certainly ways\nof solving the problem different from the one which we\nhave given. In these cases we have still stated a solution,\nin order to be concrete—to provide the reader with at\nleast one way of solving the problem-—but the task of\nfinding the true invariant, the true property which hes\nat the heart of all possible solutions to this problem, re-\nmains undone.\nWe hope, of course, that many of the people who\nread, and use this language, will try to improve these\npatterns—will put their energy to work, in this task of\nfinding more true, more profound invariants—and we\nhope that gradually these more true patterns, which are\nslowly discovered, as time goes on, will enter a common\nlanguage, which all of us can share.\nYou see then that the patterns are very much alive\nand evolving. In fact, if you like, each pattern may be\nlooked upon as a hypothesis like one of the hypotheses of\nscience. In this sense, each pattern represents our current\nbest guess as to what arrangement of the physical envi-\nronment will work to solve the problem presented. The\nempirical questions center on the problem—does it occur\nand is it felt in the way we have described it?—-and the\nsolution—-does the arrangement we propose in fact re-\nsolve the problem? And the asterisks represent our\ndegree of faith in these hypotheses. But of course, no\nmatter what the asterisks say, the patterns are still\nhypotheses, all 253 of them-—-and are therefore all\ntentative, all free to evolve under the impact of new\nexperience and observation.\nLet us finally explain the status of this language, why\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwe have called it “A Pattern Language” with the em-\nphasis on the word “A,” and how we imagine this pat-\ntern language might be related to the countless thou-\nsands of other languages we hope that people will make\nfor themselves, in the future.\nThe Timeless Way of Building says that every society\nwhich is alive and whole, will have its own unique and\ndistinct pattern language; and further, that every in-\ndividual in such a society will have a unique language,\nshared in part, but which as a totality is unique to the\nraind of the person who has it. In this sense, in a healthy\nsociety there will be as many pattern languages as there\nare people—even though these languages are shared and\nsimular,\nThe question then arises: What exactly is the status\nof this published language? In what frame of mind, and\nwith what intention, are we publishing this language\nhere? The fact that it is published as a book means that\nmany thousands of people can use it. Is it not true that\nthere is a danger that people might come to rely on this\none printed language, instead of developing their own\nlanguages, in their own minds?\nThe fact is, that we have written this book as a first\nstep in the society-wide process by which people will\ngradually become conscious of their own pattern lan-\nguages, and work to improve them. We believe, and\nhave explained in The Timeless Way of Building, that\nthe languages which people have today are so brutal, and\nso fragmented, that most people no longer have any\nlanguage to speak of at all—and what they do have is\nnot based on human, or natural considerations.\nXVI\n& PATTERN LANGUAGE\nWe have spent years trying to formulate this lan-\nguage, in the hope that when a person uses tt, he will\nbe so impressed by its power, and so joyful in its use,\nthat he will understand again, what it means to have a\nliving language of this kind. [If we only succeed in that,\nit is possible that each person may once again embark on\nthe construction and development of his own language—\nperhaps taking the language printed in this book, as a\npoint of departure.\nAnd yet, we do believe, of course, that this language\nwhich is printed here is something more than a manual,\nor a teacher, or a version of a possible pattern language.\nMany of the patterns here are archetypal—so deep, so\ndeeply rooted in the nature of things, that it seems likely\nthat they will be a part of human nature, and human ac-\ntion, as much in five hundred years, as they are today.\nWe doubt very much whether anyone could construct\na valid pattern language, in his own mind, which did\nnot include the pattern arcapes (119) for example, or\nthe pattern aLcoves (179).\nIn this sense, we have also tried to penetrate, as deep\nas we are able, into the nature of things in the environ-\nment: and hope that a great part of this language, which\nwe print here, will be a core of any sensible human pat-\ntern language, which any person constructs for himself,\nin his own mind. In this sense, at least a part of the\nlanguage we have presented here, is the archetypal core\nof all possible pattern languages, which can make people\nfeel alive and human.\nXVII\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nA pattern language has the structure of a network. This\nis explained fully in The Timeless Way of Bualdimg.\nHowever, when we use the network of a language, we\nalways use it as a sequence, going through the patterns,\nmoving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,\nalways from the ones which create structures, to the ones\nwhich then embellish those structures, and then to those\nwhich embellish the embellishments. . . .\nSince the language is in truth a network, there is no\none sequence which perfectly captures it. But the se-\nquence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the\nfull network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down,\ndips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little\nlike a needle following a tapestry.\nThe sequence of patterns is both a summary of the\nlanguage, and at the same time, an index to the patterns.\nIf you read through the sentences which connect the\ngroups of patterns to one another, you will get an over-\nview of the whole language. And once you get this over-\nview, you will then be able to find the patterns which\nare relevant to your own project.\nAnd finally, as we shall explain in the next section,\nthis sequence of patterns is also the “base map,” from\nKVL\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nwhich you can make a language for your own project,\nby choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,\nand leaving them more or less in the order that you\nfind them printed here.\nWe begin with that part of the language which defines\na town or community. These patterns can never be “de-\nsigned” or “buil?” in one fell swoop—but patient piece-\nmeal growth, designed in such a way that every indi-\nvidual act is always helping to create or generate these\nlarger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the\nyears, make a community that has these global patterns\nin tk.\nI.

They create\na coherent picture of an entire region, with the power\nto generate such regions in a million forms, with in-\nfinite variety in all the details.\nIt 1s also true that any small sequence of patterns from\nthis language is itself a language for a smaller part of\nthe environment; and this small list of patterns is then\ncapable of generating a million parks, paths, houses,\nworkshops, or gardens.\nFor example, consider the following ten patterns:\nPRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET (140)\nSUNNY PLACE (161)\nOUTDOOR ROOM (163)\nSIX-FOOT BALCONY (167)\nPATHS AND GOALS (120)\nCEILING HEIGHT VARIETY (190)\nCOLUMNS AT THE CORNERS (212)\nFRONT DOOR BENCH (242)\nRAISED FLOWERS (245)\nDIFFERENT CHAIRS (251)\nThis short list of patterns is itself a language: it is one\nof a thousand possible languages for a porch, at the front\nof a house, One of us chose this small language, to build\nAXERV\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBYJECT\na porch onto the front of his house. This is the way the\nlanguage, and its patterns, helped to generate this porch.\nI started with PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE sTREET (140). That\npattern calls for a terrace, slightly raised, connected to the house,\nand on the street side. suNNY PLACE (161) suggests that a special\nplace on the sunny side of the yard should be intensified and\nmade into a place by the use of a patio, balcony, outdoor room,\netc, | used these two patterns to locate a raised platform on the\nsouth side of the house.\nit half under the existing roof overhang, and kept a mature\npyracanthus tree right smack in the middle of the platform. The\noverhead foliage of the tree added to the roof-like enclosure of\nthe space. I put a wind screen of fixed glass on the west side of\nthe platform too, to give it even more enclosure.\nplatform. But this pattern had to be used judiciously and not\nblindly—the reasoning for the pattern has to do with the mini-\nmum space required for people to sit comfortably and carry on a\ndiscussion around a small side-table. Since 1 wanted space for at\nleast two of these conversation areas—one under the roof for very\nfeet square.\nNow PATHS AND Goats (120): Usually, this pattern deals with\nlarge paths in a neighborhood, and comes much earlier in a lan-\nguage. But I used it in a special way. It says that the paths which\nnaturally get formed by people’s walking, on the land, should be\npreserved and intensified. Since the path to our front door cut\nright across the corner of the place where 1 had planned to put\nthe platform, 1 cut the corner of the platform aff.\nThe height of the platform above the ground was determined\nby CEILING HEIGHT varieETY (190). By building the platform\napproximately one foot above the ground line, the ceiling height\nof the covered portion came out at between 6 and 7 feet——just\nright for a space as small as this. Since this height above the\nBOOR BENCH (242) was automatically satisfied.\nThere were three columns standing, supporting the roof over\nXXXVI]ground level is just about right for sitting, the pattern FRONT\nhot or rainy days, and one out under the sky for days when you\nwanted to be full in the sun, the balcony had to be made 12 x 12\nI used six-Foor BaLcony (167) to determine the size of the\nTo make this platform into an ovTsoor Room (163), I put\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nthe old porch, They had to stay where they are, because they hold\nthe roof up. But, following covumns ar THE coRNERs (212),\nthe platform was very carefully tailored to their positions—so that\nthe columns help define the social spaces on either side of them.\nFinally, we put a couple of flower boxes next to the “front door\nbench”—it’s nice to smell them when you sit there—according to\nRAISED FLowERs (245). And the old chairs you can see in the\nporch are DIeFERENT CHAIRS (251).\nYou can see, from this short example, how powerful\nand simple a pattern language is, And you are now,\nperhaps ready to appreciate how careful you must be,\nwhen you construct a language for yourself and your\nown project.\nThe character of the porch is given by the ten patterns\nin this short language. In just this way, each part of the\nenvironment is given its character by the collection of\npatterns which we choose to build into it. The character\nof what you build, will be given to it by the language of\npatterns you use, to generate it.\nXxxvii\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nFor this reason, of course, the task of choosing a lan-\nguage for your project is fundamental. The pattern lan-\nguage we have given here contains 253 patterns. You\ncan therefore use it to generate an almost unimaginably\nlarge number of possible different smaller languages,\nfor all the different projects you may choose to do,\nsimply by picking patterns from it.\nWe shall now describe a rough procedure by which\nyou can choose a language for your own project, first by\ntaking patterns from this language we have printed here,\nand then by adding patterns of your own.\nr. First of all, make a copy of the master sequence\n(pages xix-xxxiv) on which you can tick off the patterns\nwhich will form the language for your project. If you\ndon’t have access to a copying machine, you can tick off\npatterns in the list printed in the book, use paper clips\nto mark pages, write your own list, use paper markers—\nwhatever you like. But just for now, to explain it clearly,\nwe shall assume that you have a copy of the list in front\nof you.\n2. Scan down the list, and find the pattern which\nbest describes the overall scope of the project you have\nin mind, This is the starting pattern for your project.\nTick it. CIE there are two or three possible candidates,\ndon’t worry: just pick the one which seems best: the\nothers will fall in place as you move forward.)\n3. Turn to the starting pattern itself, in the book, and\nread it through. Notice that the other patterns men-\ntioned by name at the beginning and at the end, of the\npattern you are reading, are also possible candidates for\nyour language. The ones at the beginning will tend to be\n“larger” than your project. Don’t include them, unless\nXXXVI\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nyou have the power to help create these patterns, at least\nin a small way, in the world around your project. The\nones at the end are “smaller.” Almost all of them will\nbe important. Tick all of them, on your list, unless you\nhave some special reason for not wanting to include\nthem.\n4. Now your list has some more ticks on it. Turn to\nthe next highest pattern on the list which is ticked, and\nopen the book to that pattern. Once again, it will lead\nyou to other patterns. Once again, tick those which are\nrelevant—especially the ones which are “smaller” that\ncome at the end. As a general rule, do not tick the ones\nwhich are “larger” unless you can do something about\nthem, concretely, in your own project.\n5. When in doubt about a pattern, don’t include it.\nYour list can easily get too long: and if it does, it will\nbecome confusing. The list will be quite long enough,\neven if you only include the patterns you especially like.\n6. Keep going like this, until you have ticked all the\npatterns you want for your project.\n7. Now, adjust the sequence by adding your own ma-\nterial. If there are things you want to include in your\nproject, but you have not been able to find patterns which\ncorrespond to them, then write them in, at an appropri-\nate point in the sequence, near other patterns which are\nof about the same size and importance. For example,\nthere is no pattern for a sauna. If you want to include\none, write it in somewhere near BATHING ROOM (144)\nin your sequence.\n8. And of course, if you want to change any patterns,\nchange them. There are often cases where you may have\na personal version of a pattern, which is more true, or\nXXXIN\nCHOCSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nmore relevant for you. In this case, you will get the most\n“power” over the language, and make it your own most\neffectively, if you write the changes in, at the appropri-\nate places in the book. And, it will be most concrete of\nall, if you change the name of the pattern too—so that\nit captures your own changes clearly.\nyp oe\nSuppose now that you have a language for your proj-\nect. The way to use the language depends very much\non its scale. Patterns dealing with towns can only be\nimplemented gradually, by grass roots action; patterns\nfor a building can be built up in your mind, and marked\nout on the ground; patterns for construction must be\nbuilt physically, on the site. For this reason we have\ngiven three separate instructions, for these three different\nscales. For towns, see page 3; for buildings, see page\n463; for construction, see page 935.\nThe procedures for each of these three scales are de-\nscribed in much more detail with extensive examples,\nin the appropriate chapters of The Timeless Way of\nBuilding. For the town—see chapters 24 and 25; for an\nindividual building—see chapters 20, 21, and 22; and for\nthe process of construction which describes the way a\nbuilding is actually built see chapter 23.\nxh\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nFinally, a note of caution. This language, lke English,\ncan be a medium for prose, or a medium for poetry. The\ndifference between prose and poetry is not that different\nJanpuages are used, but that the same language is used,\ndifferently. In an ordinary English sentence, each word\nhas one meaning, and the sentence too, has one simple\nmeaning. In a poem, the meaning is far more dense.\nEach word carries several meanings; and the sentence\nas a Whole carries an enormous density of interlocking\nmeanings, which together illuminate the whole.\nThe same is true for pattern languages. It is possible\nto make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a\nrather loose way. A building made like this, is an as-\nsembly of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound.\nBut it 1s also possible to put patterns together in such a\nway that many many patterns overlap in the same\nphysical space: the building is very dense; it has many\nmeanings captured in a small space; and through this\ndensity, it becomes profound.\nIn a poern, this kind of density, creates illumination,\nby making identities between words, and meanings,\nwhose identity we have not understood before. In “O\nRose thou art sick,” the rose is identifed with many\nxii\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\ngreater, and more personal things than any rose—and\nthe poem illuminates the person, and the rose, because of\nthis connection. The connection not only illuminates the\nwords, but also illuminates our actual lives.\n© Rose thon art sick,\n‘The invisible worm,\nThat flies in the night\nin the howling storm:\nHas found out thy bed\nOF crimson joy:\nAnd his dark secret Jove\nDoes thy life destroy,\nWILLIAM BLAKE\nThe same exactly, happens in a building, Consider, for\nexample, the two patterns BATHING ROOM (144) and\nSTILL WATER (71). One defines a part of a house where\nyou can bathe yourself slowly, with pleasure, perhaps\nin company; a place to rest your limbs, and to relax. The\nother is a place in a neighborhood, where this is water\nto gaze into, perhaps to swim in, where children can sail\nboats, and splash about, which nourishes those parts of\nourselves which rely on water as one of the great\nelements of the unconscious.\nSuppose now, that we make a complex of buildings\nwhere individual bathing rooms are somehow connected\nto a common pond, or lake, or pool—where the bathing\nroom merges with this common place; where there is no\nsharp distinction between the individual and family pro-\ncesses of the bathing room, and the common pleasure\nof the common pool. In this place, these two patterns\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nexist in the same space; they are identified, there is a\ncompression of the two, which requires less space, and\nwhich is more profound than in a place where they are\nmerely side by side. The compression illuminates each\nof the patterns, sheds light on its meaning; and also i-\nluminates our lives, as we understand a little more about\nthe connections of our inner needs.\nBut this kind of compression is not only poetic and\nprofound. It is not only the stuff of poems and exotic\nstatements, but to some degree, the stuff of every English\nsentence. To some depree, there is compression in every\nsingle word we utter, just because each word carries the\nwhisper of the meanings of the words it is connected to.\nEven “Please pass the butter, Fred” has some compres-\nsion in it, because it carries overtones that lie in the con-\nnections of these words to all the words which came be-\nfore it.\nFach of us, talking to our friends, or to our families,\nmakes use of these compressions, which are drawn out\nfrom the connections between words which are given by\nthe language. The more we can feel all the connections\nin the language, the more rich and subtle are the things\nwe say at the most ordinary times.\nAnd once again, the same is true in building. The com-\npression of patterns into a single space, is not a poetic\nand exotic thing, kept for special buildings which are\nworks of art. It is the most ordinary economy of space. It\nis quite possible that all the patterns for a house might,\nin some form be present, and overlapping, in a simple\none-room cabin, The patterns do not need to be strung\nout, and kept separate. Every building, every room,\nxd\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nevery garden is better, when all the patterns which it\nneeds are compressed as far as it is possible for them to\nbe. The building will be cheaper; and the meanings in it\nwill be denser.\nIt is essential then, once you have learned to use the\nlanguage, that you pay attention to the possibility of\ncompressing the many patterns which you put together,\nin the smallest possible space. You may think of this\nprocess of compressing patterns, as a way to make the\ncheapest possible building which has the necessary pat-\nterns in it. It is, also, the only way of using a pattern\nlanguage to make buildings which are poems.\n","summary":"This chunk discusses the pattern \"Neighborhood Boundary\" which is part of the larger pattern language for designing towns and communities. It explains the importance of having a defined boundary around a neighborhood to protect its unique character and identity, and provides guidelines for how to create such a boundary.","chunk":"# 15 Neighborhood Boundary*\n\n![29_Image_0.Png](29_Image_0.Png)\n\n. . . the physical boundary needed to protect subcultures from one another, and to allow their ways of life to be unique and. idiosyncratic, is guaranteed, for a community of 7000 (12), by the pattern subculture Boundary (13). But a second, smaller kind of boundary is needed to create the smaller IDENTIFIABLE\nNEIGHBORHOOD (14).\n\nThe strength of the boundary is essential to a neighborhood. If the boundary is too weak the neighborhood will not be able to maintain its own identifiable character.\n\nThe cell wall of an organic cell is, in most cases, as large as, or larger, than the cell interior. It is not a surface which divides inside from outside, but a coherent entity in its own right, which preserves the functional integrity of the cell and also provides for a multitude of transactions between the cell interior and the ambient fluids.\n\n![30_image_0.png](30_image_0.png)\n\nCell with cell wall: The cell wall is a place in its ocon right.\n\nWe have already argued, in subculTURE BOUNDARY (13),\nthat a human group, with a specific life style, needs a boundary around it to protect its idiosyncrasies from encroachment and dilution by surrounding ways of life. This subculture boundary,\n\nthen, functions just like a cell wall-it protects the subculture and creates space for its transactions with surrounding functions.\n\nThe argument applies as strongly to an individual neighborhood, which is a subculture in microcosm.\n\nHowever, where the subculture boundaries require wide swaths of land and commercial and industrial activity, the neighborhood boundaries can be much more modest. Indeed it is not possible for a neighborhood of 500 or more to bound itself with shops and streets and community facilities; there simply aren't enough to go around. Of course, the few neighborhood shops there arethe STREET CAFE (88), the corner GROCERY (89)-will help to form the edge of the neighborhood, but by and large the boundary of neighborhoods will have to come from a completely different morphological principle.\n\nFrom observations of neighborhoods that succeed in being welldefined, both physically and in the minds of the townspeople, we have learned that the single most important feature of a neighborhood's boundary is restricted access into the neighborhood:\nneighborhoods that are successfully defined have definite and relatively few paths and roads leading into them.\n\nFor example, here is a map of the Etna Street neighborhood in Berkeley.\n\n![31_image_0.png](31_image_0.png)\n\nOur neighborhood, compared with a typical part of a grid system.\nThere are only seven roads into this neighborhood, compared with the fourteen which there would be in a typical part of the street grid. The other roads all dead end in T junctions immediately at the edge of the neighborhood. Thus, while the Etna Street neighborhood is not literally walled off from the community, access into it is subtly restricted. The result is that people do not come into the neighborhood by car unless they have \n\nbusiness there; and when people are in the neighborhood, they recognize that they are iss a distinct part of town. Of course, the neighborhood was not \"created\" deliberately. It was an area of Berkeley which has become an identifiable neighborhood because of this accident in the street system.\n\nAn extreme example of this principle is the Fuggerei in Augsburg, illustrated in IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD (14). The Fuggerei is entirely bounded by the backs of buildings and walls, and the paths into it are narrow, marked by gateways.\n\nIndeed, if access is restricted, this means, by definition, that those few points where access is possible, will come to have special importance. In one way or another, subtly, or more obviously, they will be gateways, which mark the passage into the neighborhood. We discuss this more fully in MAIN GATEWAYS (53). But the fact is that every successful neighborhood is identifiable because it has some kind of gateways which mark its boundaries: the boundary comes alive in peoples' minds because they recognize the gateways.\n\nIn case the idea of gateways seems too closed, we remark at once that the boundary zone-and especially those parts of it around the gateways-must also form a kind of public meeting ground, where neighborhoods come together. If each neighborhood is a self-contained entity, then the community of 7000 which the neighborhoods belong to will not control any of the land internal to the neighborhoods. But it will control all of the land between the neighborhoods-the boundary land-because this boundary land is just where functions common to all 7000 people must find space. In this sense the boundaries not only serve to protect individual neighborhoods, but simultaneously function to unite them in their larger processes.\n\nTherefore:\nEncourage the formation of a boundary around each neighborhood, to separate it from the next door neighborhoods. Form this boundary by closing down streets and limiting access to the neighborhood-cut the normal number of streets at least in half. Place gateways at those points where the restricted access paths cross the boundary; and\n\nmake the boundary zone wide enough to contain meeting places for the common functions shared by several neighborhoods.\n\n![33_image_0.png](33_image_0.png)\n\n-\n.\n\n-\nThe easiest way of all to form a boundary around a neighborhood is by turning buildings inward, and by cutting off the paths which cross the boundary, except for one or two at special points which become gateways-MAIN GATEWAYS (53); the public land of the boundary may include a park, collector roads, small parking lots, and work communities-anything which forms a natural edge-PARALLEL ROADS (23), WORK COMMUNITY (41),\nQUIET BACKS (59), ACCESSIBLE CREEN (60), SHIELDED PARKING\n(97), SMALL PARKING LOTS (103). As for the meeting places in the boundary, they can be any of those neighborhood functions which invite gathering: a park, a shared garage, an outdoor room, a shopping street, a playground-sHOPPING STREET (32), POOLS\nAND STREAMS (64), PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM (69), GRAVE SITES\n(70), LOCAL SPORTS (72), ADVENTURE PLAYGROUND (73). . . .\n\n## ੇਰ\n\nconnect communities to one another by encouraging the growth of the following networks :\n16.

This book. describes the\ndetailed patterns for towns and neighborhoods, houses,\ngardens, and rooms. The other book explains the disci-\npline which makes it possible to use these patterns to\ncreate a building or a town. This book is the sourcebook of\nthe timeless way; the other is its practice and its origin.\nThe two books have evolved very much in parallel.\nThey have been growing over the last eight years, as\nwe have worked on the one hand to understand the\nnature of the building process, and on the other hand to\nconstruct an actual, possible pattern language. We have\nbeen forced by practical considerations, to publish these\ntwo books under separate covers; but in fact, they form\nan indivisible whole. It is possible to read them sepa-\nrately. But to gain the insight which we have tried to\ncommunicate in them, it is essential that you read them\nboth.\nThe Timeless Way of Building describes the funda-\nmental nature of the task of making towns and buildings.\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nIt is shown there, that towns and buildings will not be\nable to become alive, unless they are made by all the\npeople in society, and unless these people share a com-\nmon pattern language, within which to make these\nbuildings, and unless this cornmon pattern language is\nalive itself.\nTn this book, we present one possible pattern language,\nof the kind called for in The Timeless Way. This lan-\nguage is extremely practical. It is a language that we\nhave distilled from our own building and planning ef-\nforts over the last eight years. You can use it to work\nwith your neighbors, to improve your town and neighbor-\nhood. You can use it to design a house for yourself,\nwith your family; or to work with other people to de-\nsign an office or a workshop or a public building like a\nschool. And you can use it to guide you in the actual\nprocess of construction.\nThe elements of this language are entities called pat-\nterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs\nover and over again in our environment, and then\ndescribes the core of the solution to that problem, in such\na way that you can use this solution a million times over,\nwithout ever doing it the same way twice.\nFor convenience and clarity, each pattern has the same\nformat. First, there is a picture, which shows an arche-\ntypal example of that pattern. Second, after the picture,\neach pattern has an introductory paragraph, which sets\nthe context for the pattern, by explaining how it helps\nto complete certain larger patterns. Then there are three\ndiamonds to mark the beginning of the problem. After\nthe diamonds there is a headline, in bold type. This\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nheadline gives the essence of the problem in one or two\nsentences. After the headline comes the body of the\nproblem. This is the longest section. It describes the\nempirical background of the pattern, the evidence for its\nvalidity, the range of different ways the pattern can be\nmanifested in a building, and so on. Then, again in\nbold type, like the headline, is the solution—the heart\nof the pattern—which describes the field of physical and\nsocial relationships which are required to solve the stated\nproblem, in the stated context. This solution is always\nexactly what you need to do, to build the pattern. Then,\nafter the solution, there is a diagram, which shows the\nsolution in the form of a diagram, with labels to indicate\nits main components.\nAfter the diagram, another three diamonds, to show\nthat the main body of the pattern is finished. And finally,\nafter the diamonds there is a paragraph which ties the\npattern to all those smaller patterns in the language,\nwhich are needed to complete this pattern, to embellish\nit, to All it out.\nThere are two essential purposes behind this format.\nFirst, to present each pattern connected to other patterns,\nso that you grasp the collection of all 253 patterns as a\nwhole, as a language, within which you can create an in-\nfinite variety of combinations. Second, to present the\nproblem and solution of each pattern in such a way that\nyou can judge it for yourself, and modify it, without\nlosing the essence that is central to it.\nLet us next understand the nature of the connection\nbetween patterns.\nXI\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nThe patterns are ordered, beginning with the very\nlargest, for regions and towns, then working down\nthrough neighborhoods, clusters of buildings, buildings,\nrooms and alcoves, ending finally with details of con-\nstruction.\nThis order, which is presented as a straight linear\nsequerice, is essential to the way the language works. It is\npresented, and explained more fully, in the next section.\nWhat is most important about this sequence, is that it is\nbased on the connections between the patterns. Each\npattern is connected to certain “larger” patterns which\ncome above it in the language; and to certain “smaller”\npatterns which come below it in the language. The pat-\ntern helps to complete those larger patterns which are\n“above” it, and is itself completed by those smaller pat-\nterns which are “below” it.\nThus, for example, you will find that the pattern ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN (60), is connected first to certain larger\npatterns: SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY (13), IDENTIFIABLE\nNEIGHBORHOOD (14), WORK COMMUNITY (41), and\nquirr Backs (59). These appear on its first page. And it\nis also connected to certain smaller patterns: PosiTIVE\nOUTDOOR SPACE (107), TREE PLACES (171), and GARDEN\nWALL (173). These appear on its last page.\nWhat this means, is that IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBOR-\nHOOD, SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, WORK COMMUNITY, and\nQUIET BACKS are incomplete, unless they contain an ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN; and that an ACCESSIBLE GREEN is itself\nincomplete, unless it contains POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nAnd what it means in practical terms is that, if you\nx\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to lay out a green according to this pattern, you\nmust not only follow the instructions which describe the\npattern itself, but must also try to embed the green\nWithin an IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD or in some sUB-\nCULTURE BOUNDARY, and in a way that helps to form\nquizr Backs; and then you must work to complete the\ngreen by building in some posiTIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nIn short, no pattern is an isolated entity. Each pattern\ncan exist in the world, only to the extent that is sup-\nported by other patterns: the larger patterns in which it\nis embedded, the patterns of the same size that surround\nit, and the smaller patterns which are embedded in it.\nThis is a fundamental view of the world, It says that\nwhen you build a thing you cannot merely build that\nthing in isolation, but must also repair the world around\nit, and within it, so that the larger world at that one\nplace becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the\nthing which you make takes its place in the web of na-\nture, as you make it.\nNow we explain the nature of the relation between\nproblems and solutions, within the individual patterns.\nEach solution is stated in such a way that it gives the\nessential field of relationships needed to solve the prob-\nlem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you\ncan solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by\nadapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions\nat the place where you are making it.\nFor this reason, we have tried to write each solution\nin a way which imposes nothing on you. It contains only\nthose essentials which cannot be avoided if you really\nXU\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to solve the problem. In this sense, we have tried,\nin each solution, to capture the invariant property com-\nmon to all places which succeed in solving the problem.\nBut of course, we have not always succeeded. The\nsolutions we have given to these problems vary in signif-\ncance, Some are more true, more profound, more cer-\ntain, than others. To show this clearly we have marked\nevery pattern, in the text itself, with two asterisks, or one\nasterisk, or no asterisks.\nIn the patterns marked with two asterisks, we believe\nthat we have succeeded in stating a true invariant: in\nshort, that the solution we have stated summarizes a\nproperty common to all possible ways of solving the\nstated problem. In these two-asterisk cases we believe,\nin short, that it is not possible to solve the stated prob-\nlem properly, without shaping the environment in one\nway or another according to the pattern that we have\ngiven—and that, in these cases, the pattern describes\na deep and inescapable property of a well-formed en-\nvironment.\nIn the patterns marked with one asterisk, we believe\nthat we have made some progress towards identifying\nsuch an invariant: but that with careful work it will\ncertainly be possible to improve on the solution, In\nthese cases, we believe it would be wise for you to treat\nthe pattern with a certain amount of disrespect—and\nthat you seek out variants of the solution which we have\ngiven, since there are almost certainly possible ranges of\nsolutions which are not covered by what we have written.\nFinally, in the patterns without an asterisk, we are\ncertain that we have mot succeeded in defining a true\nx1V\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\ninvariant—that, on the contrary, there are certainly ways\nof solving the problem different from the one which we\nhave given. In these cases we have still stated a solution,\nin order to be concrete—to provide the reader with at\nleast one way of solving the problem-—but the task of\nfinding the true invariant, the true property which hes\nat the heart of all possible solutions to this problem, re-\nmains undone.\nWe hope, of course, that many of the people who\nread, and use this language, will try to improve these\npatterns—will put their energy to work, in this task of\nfinding more true, more profound invariants—and we\nhope that gradually these more true patterns, which are\nslowly discovered, as time goes on, will enter a common\nlanguage, which all of us can share.\nYou see then that the patterns are very much alive\nand evolving. In fact, if you like, each pattern may be\nlooked upon as a hypothesis like one of the hypotheses of\nscience. In this sense, each pattern represents our current\nbest guess as to what arrangement of the physical envi-\nronment will work to solve the problem presented. The\nempirical questions center on the problem—does it occur\nand is it felt in the way we have described it?—-and the\nsolution—-does the arrangement we propose in fact re-\nsolve the problem? And the asterisks represent our\ndegree of faith in these hypotheses. But of course, no\nmatter what the asterisks say, the patterns are still\nhypotheses, all 253 of them-—-and are therefore all\ntentative, all free to evolve under the impact of new\nexperience and observation.\nLet us finally explain the status of this language, why\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwe have called it “A Pattern Language” with the em-\nphasis on the word “A,” and how we imagine this pat-\ntern language might be related to the countless thou-\nsands of other languages we hope that people will make\nfor themselves, in the future.\nThe Timeless Way of Building says that every society\nwhich is alive and whole, will have its own unique and\ndistinct pattern language; and further, that every in-\ndividual in such a society will have a unique language,\nshared in part, but which as a totality is unique to the\nraind of the person who has it. In this sense, in a healthy\nsociety there will be as many pattern languages as there\nare people—even though these languages are shared and\nsimular,\nThe question then arises: What exactly is the status\nof this published language? In what frame of mind, and\nwith what intention, are we publishing this language\nhere? The fact that it is published as a book means that\nmany thousands of people can use it. Is it not true that\nthere is a danger that people might come to rely on this\none printed language, instead of developing their own\nlanguages, in their own minds?\nThe fact is, that we have written this book as a first\nstep in the society-wide process by which people will\ngradually become conscious of their own pattern lan-\nguages, and work to improve them. We believe, and\nhave explained in The Timeless Way of Building, that\nthe languages which people have today are so brutal, and\nso fragmented, that most people no longer have any\nlanguage to speak of at all—and what they do have is\nnot based on human, or natural considerations.\nXVI\n& PATTERN LANGUAGE\nWe have spent years trying to formulate this lan-\nguage, in the hope that when a person uses tt, he will\nbe so impressed by its power, and so joyful in its use,\nthat he will understand again, what it means to have a\nliving language of this kind. [If we only succeed in that,\nit is possible that each person may once again embark on\nthe construction and development of his own language—\nperhaps taking the language printed in this book, as a\npoint of departure.\nAnd yet, we do believe, of course, that this language\nwhich is printed here is something more than a manual,\nor a teacher, or a version of a possible pattern language.\nMany of the patterns here are archetypal—so deep, so\ndeeply rooted in the nature of things, that it seems likely\nthat they will be a part of human nature, and human ac-\ntion, as much in five hundred years, as they are today.\nWe doubt very much whether anyone could construct\na valid pattern language, in his own mind, which did\nnot include the pattern arcapes (119) for example, or\nthe pattern aLcoves (179).\nIn this sense, we have also tried to penetrate, as deep\nas we are able, into the nature of things in the environ-\nment: and hope that a great part of this language, which\nwe print here, will be a core of any sensible human pat-\ntern language, which any person constructs for himself,\nin his own mind. In this sense, at least a part of the\nlanguage we have presented here, is the archetypal core\nof all possible pattern languages, which can make people\nfeel alive and human.\nXVII\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nA pattern language has the structure of a network. This\nis explained fully in The Timeless Way of Bualdimg.\nHowever, when we use the network of a language, we\nalways use it as a sequence, going through the patterns,\nmoving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,\nalways from the ones which create structures, to the ones\nwhich then embellish those structures, and then to those\nwhich embellish the embellishments. . . .\nSince the language is in truth a network, there is no\none sequence which perfectly captures it. But the se-\nquence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the\nfull network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down,\ndips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little\nlike a needle following a tapestry.\nThe sequence of patterns is both a summary of the\nlanguage, and at the same time, an index to the patterns.\nIf you read through the sentences which connect the\ngroups of patterns to one another, you will get an over-\nview of the whole language. And once you get this over-\nview, you will then be able to find the patterns which\nare relevant to your own project.\nAnd finally, as we shall explain in the next section,\nthis sequence of patterns is also the “base map,” from\nKVL\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nwhich you can make a language for your own project,\nby choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,\nand leaving them more or less in the order that you\nfind them printed here.\nWe begin with that part of the language which defines\na town or community. These patterns can never be “de-\nsigned” or “buil?” in one fell swoop—but patient piece-\nmeal growth, designed in such a way that every indi-\nvidual act is always helping to create or generate these\nlarger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the\nyears, make a community that has these global patterns\nin tk.\nI.

They create\na coherent picture of an entire region, with the power\nto generate such regions in a million forms, with in-\nfinite variety in all the details.\nIt 1s also true that any small sequence of patterns from\nthis language is itself a language for a smaller part of\nthe environment; and this small list of patterns is then\ncapable of generating a million parks, paths, houses,\nworkshops, or gardens.\nFor example, consider the following ten patterns:\nPRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET (140)\nSUNNY PLACE (161)\nOUTDOOR ROOM (163)\nSIX-FOOT BALCONY (167)\nPATHS AND GOALS (120)\nCEILING HEIGHT VARIETY (190)\nCOLUMNS AT THE CORNERS (212)\nFRONT DOOR BENCH (242)\nRAISED FLOWERS (245)\nDIFFERENT CHAIRS (251)\nThis short list of patterns is itself a language: it is one\nof a thousand possible languages for a porch, at the front\nof a house, One of us chose this small language, to build\nAXERV\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBYJECT\na porch onto the front of his house. This is the way the\nlanguage, and its patterns, helped to generate this porch.\nI started with PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE sTREET (140). That\npattern calls for a terrace, slightly raised, connected to the house,\nand on the street side. suNNY PLACE (161) suggests that a special\nplace on the sunny side of the yard should be intensified and\nmade into a place by the use of a patio, balcony, outdoor room,\netc, | used these two patterns to locate a raised platform on the\nsouth side of the house.\nit half under the existing roof overhang, and kept a mature\npyracanthus tree right smack in the middle of the platform. The\noverhead foliage of the tree added to the roof-like enclosure of\nthe space. I put a wind screen of fixed glass on the west side of\nthe platform too, to give it even more enclosure.\nplatform. But this pattern had to be used judiciously and not\nblindly—the reasoning for the pattern has to do with the mini-\nmum space required for people to sit comfortably and carry on a\ndiscussion around a small side-table. Since 1 wanted space for at\nleast two of these conversation areas—one under the roof for very\nfeet square.\nNow PATHS AND Goats (120): Usually, this pattern deals with\nlarge paths in a neighborhood, and comes much earlier in a lan-\nguage. But I used it in a special way. It says that the paths which\nnaturally get formed by people’s walking, on the land, should be\npreserved and intensified. Since the path to our front door cut\nright across the corner of the place where 1 had planned to put\nthe platform, 1 cut the corner of the platform aff.\nThe height of the platform above the ground was determined\nby CEILING HEIGHT varieETY (190). By building the platform\napproximately one foot above the ground line, the ceiling height\nof the covered portion came out at between 6 and 7 feet——just\nright for a space as small as this. Since this height above the\nBOOR BENCH (242) was automatically satisfied.\nThere were three columns standing, supporting the roof over\nXXXVI]ground level is just about right for sitting, the pattern FRONT\nhot or rainy days, and one out under the sky for days when you\nwanted to be full in the sun, the balcony had to be made 12 x 12\nI used six-Foor BaLcony (167) to determine the size of the\nTo make this platform into an ovTsoor Room (163), I put\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nthe old porch, They had to stay where they are, because they hold\nthe roof up. But, following covumns ar THE coRNERs (212),\nthe platform was very carefully tailored to their positions—so that\nthe columns help define the social spaces on either side of them.\nFinally, we put a couple of flower boxes next to the “front door\nbench”—it’s nice to smell them when you sit there—according to\nRAISED FLowERs (245). And the old chairs you can see in the\nporch are DIeFERENT CHAIRS (251).\nYou can see, from this short example, how powerful\nand simple a pattern language is, And you are now,\nperhaps ready to appreciate how careful you must be,\nwhen you construct a language for yourself and your\nown project.\nThe character of the porch is given by the ten patterns\nin this short language. In just this way, each part of the\nenvironment is given its character by the collection of\npatterns which we choose to build into it. The character\nof what you build, will be given to it by the language of\npatterns you use, to generate it.\nXxxvii\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nFor this reason, of course, the task of choosing a lan-\nguage for your project is fundamental. The pattern lan-\nguage we have given here contains 253 patterns. You\ncan therefore use it to generate an almost unimaginably\nlarge number of possible different smaller languages,\nfor all the different projects you may choose to do,\nsimply by picking patterns from it.\nWe shall now describe a rough procedure by which\nyou can choose a language for your own project, first by\ntaking patterns from this language we have printed here,\nand then by adding patterns of your own.\nr. First of all, make a copy of the master sequence\n(pages xix-xxxiv) on which you can tick off the patterns\nwhich will form the language for your project. If you\ndon’t have access to a copying machine, you can tick off\npatterns in the list printed in the book, use paper clips\nto mark pages, write your own list, use paper markers—\nwhatever you like. But just for now, to explain it clearly,\nwe shall assume that you have a copy of the list in front\nof you.\n2. Scan down the list, and find the pattern which\nbest describes the overall scope of the project you have\nin mind, This is the starting pattern for your project.\nTick it. CIE there are two or three possible candidates,\ndon’t worry: just pick the one which seems best: the\nothers will fall in place as you move forward.)\n3. Turn to the starting pattern itself, in the book, and\nread it through. Notice that the other patterns men-\ntioned by name at the beginning and at the end, of the\npattern you are reading, are also possible candidates for\nyour language. The ones at the beginning will tend to be\n“larger” than your project. Don’t include them, unless\nXXXVI\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nyou have the power to help create these patterns, at least\nin a small way, in the world around your project. The\nones at the end are “smaller.” Almost all of them will\nbe important. Tick all of them, on your list, unless you\nhave some special reason for not wanting to include\nthem.\n4. Now your list has some more ticks on it. Turn to\nthe next highest pattern on the list which is ticked, and\nopen the book to that pattern. Once again, it will lead\nyou to other patterns. Once again, tick those which are\nrelevant—especially the ones which are “smaller” that\ncome at the end. As a general rule, do not tick the ones\nwhich are “larger” unless you can do something about\nthem, concretely, in your own project.\n5. When in doubt about a pattern, don’t include it.\nYour list can easily get too long: and if it does, it will\nbecome confusing. The list will be quite long enough,\neven if you only include the patterns you especially like.\n6. Keep going like this, until you have ticked all the\npatterns you want for your project.\n7. Now, adjust the sequence by adding your own ma-\nterial. If there are things you want to include in your\nproject, but you have not been able to find patterns which\ncorrespond to them, then write them in, at an appropri-\nate point in the sequence, near other patterns which are\nof about the same size and importance. For example,\nthere is no pattern for a sauna. If you want to include\none, write it in somewhere near BATHING ROOM (144)\nin your sequence.\n8. And of course, if you want to change any patterns,\nchange them. There are often cases where you may have\na personal version of a pattern, which is more true, or\nXXXIN\nCHOCSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nmore relevant for you. In this case, you will get the most\n“power” over the language, and make it your own most\neffectively, if you write the changes in, at the appropri-\nate places in the book. And, it will be most concrete of\nall, if you change the name of the pattern too—so that\nit captures your own changes clearly.\nyp oe\nSuppose now that you have a language for your proj-\nect. The way to use the language depends very much\non its scale. Patterns dealing with towns can only be\nimplemented gradually, by grass roots action; patterns\nfor a building can be built up in your mind, and marked\nout on the ground; patterns for construction must be\nbuilt physically, on the site. For this reason we have\ngiven three separate instructions, for these three different\nscales. For towns, see page 3; for buildings, see page\n463; for construction, see page 935.\nThe procedures for each of these three scales are de-\nscribed in much more detail with extensive examples,\nin the appropriate chapters of The Timeless Way of\nBuilding. For the town—see chapters 24 and 25; for an\nindividual building—see chapters 20, 21, and 22; and for\nthe process of construction which describes the way a\nbuilding is actually built see chapter 23.\nxh\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nFinally, a note of caution. This language, lke English,\ncan be a medium for prose, or a medium for poetry. The\ndifference between prose and poetry is not that different\nJanpuages are used, but that the same language is used,\ndifferently. In an ordinary English sentence, each word\nhas one meaning, and the sentence too, has one simple\nmeaning. In a poem, the meaning is far more dense.\nEach word carries several meanings; and the sentence\nas a Whole carries an enormous density of interlocking\nmeanings, which together illuminate the whole.\nThe same is true for pattern languages. It is possible\nto make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a\nrather loose way. A building made like this, is an as-\nsembly of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound.\nBut it 1s also possible to put patterns together in such a\nway that many many patterns overlap in the same\nphysical space: the building is very dense; it has many\nmeanings captured in a small space; and through this\ndensity, it becomes profound.\nIn a poern, this kind of density, creates illumination,\nby making identities between words, and meanings,\nwhose identity we have not understood before. In “O\nRose thou art sick,” the rose is identifed with many\nxii\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\ngreater, and more personal things than any rose—and\nthe poem illuminates the person, and the rose, because of\nthis connection. The connection not only illuminates the\nwords, but also illuminates our actual lives.\n© Rose thon art sick,\n‘The invisible worm,\nThat flies in the night\nin the howling storm:\nHas found out thy bed\nOF crimson joy:\nAnd his dark secret Jove\nDoes thy life destroy,\nWILLIAM BLAKE\nThe same exactly, happens in a building, Consider, for\nexample, the two patterns BATHING ROOM (144) and\nSTILL WATER (71). One defines a part of a house where\nyou can bathe yourself slowly, with pleasure, perhaps\nin company; a place to rest your limbs, and to relax. The\nother is a place in a neighborhood, where this is water\nto gaze into, perhaps to swim in, where children can sail\nboats, and splash about, which nourishes those parts of\nourselves which rely on water as one of the great\nelements of the unconscious.\nSuppose now, that we make a complex of buildings\nwhere individual bathing rooms are somehow connected\nto a common pond, or lake, or pool—where the bathing\nroom merges with this common place; where there is no\nsharp distinction between the individual and family pro-\ncesses of the bathing room, and the common pleasure\nof the common pool. In this place, these two patterns\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nexist in the same space; they are identified, there is a\ncompression of the two, which requires less space, and\nwhich is more profound than in a place where they are\nmerely side by side. The compression illuminates each\nof the patterns, sheds light on its meaning; and also i-\nluminates our lives, as we understand a little more about\nthe connections of our inner needs.\nBut this kind of compression is not only poetic and\nprofound. It is not only the stuff of poems and exotic\nstatements, but to some degree, the stuff of every English\nsentence. To some depree, there is compression in every\nsingle word we utter, just because each word carries the\nwhisper of the meanings of the words it is connected to.\nEven “Please pass the butter, Fred” has some compres-\nsion in it, because it carries overtones that lie in the con-\nnections of these words to all the words which came be-\nfore it.\nFach of us, talking to our friends, or to our families,\nmakes use of these compressions, which are drawn out\nfrom the connections between words which are given by\nthe language. The more we can feel all the connections\nin the language, the more rich and subtle are the things\nwe say at the most ordinary times.\nAnd once again, the same is true in building. The com-\npression of patterns into a single space, is not a poetic\nand exotic thing, kept for special buildings which are\nworks of art. It is the most ordinary economy of space. It\nis quite possible that all the patterns for a house might,\nin some form be present, and overlapping, in a simple\none-room cabin, The patterns do not need to be strung\nout, and kept separate. Every building, every room,\nxd\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nevery garden is better, when all the patterns which it\nneeds are compressed as far as it is possible for them to\nbe.

To a lesser extent, a good neighborhood will do the same-IDENTIFI-\nABLE NEIGHBORHOOD (14). To fulfill this promise, communities and neighborhoods must have the range of things which life can need, so that a person can experience the full breadth and depth of life in his community.\n\n中 中 All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players:\nThey have their exits and their entrances; And one man in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages.\n\nAs, first the infant, Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms. And then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel And shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school. And then the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then the soldier, Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard, Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel, Seeking the bubble reputation Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice, In fair round belly with good capon lined, With eyes severe and beard of formal cut, Full of wise saws and modern instances; And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon, With spectacles on nose and pouch on side; His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice, Turning again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all, That ends this strange eventful history, Is second childishness and mere oblivion, Sans tecth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.\n\n(Shakespeare, As You Like It, II.viii.)\nTo live life to the fullest, in each of the seven ages, each age must be clearly marked, by the community, as a distinct wellmarked time. And the ages will only seem clearly marked if the\n\nceremonies which mark the passage from one age to the next are firmly marked by celebrations and distinctions.\n\nBy contrast, in a flat suburban culture the seven ages are not at all clearly marked; they are not celebrated; the passages from one age to the next have almost been forgotten. Under these conditions, people distort themselves. They can neither fulfill themselves in any one age nor pass successfully on to the next. Like the sixty-year-old woman wearing bright red lipstick on her wrinkles, they cling ferociously to what they never fully had.\n\nThis proposition hinges on two arguments.\n\nA. The cycle of life is a definite psychological reality. It consists of discrete stages, each one fraught with its own difficulties, each one with its own special advantages.\n\nB. Growth from one stage to another is not inevitable, and, in fact, it will not happen unless the community contains a balanced life cycle.\n\n## A. The Reality Of The Life Cycle.\n\nEveryone can recognize the fact that a person's life traverses several stages-infancy to old age. What is perhaps not so well understood is the idea that each stage is a discrete reality, with its own special compensations and difficulties; that each stage has certain characteristic experiences that go with it.\n\nThe most inspired work along these lines has come from Erik Erikson: \"Identity and the Life Cycle,\" in Psychological Issues, Vol. I, No. 1, New York: International Universities Press, 1959; and Childhood and Society, New York: W. W. Norton, 1950.\n\nErikson describes the sequence of phases a person must pass through as he matures and suggests that each phase is characterized by a specific developmental task-a successful resolution of some life conflict-and that this task must be solved by a person before he can move wholeheartedly forward to the next phase.\n\nHere is a summary of the stages in Erikson's scheme, adapted from his charts:\nI. Trust vs. mistrust: the infant; relationship between the infant and mother; the struggle for confidence that the environment will nourish.\n\n2. Autonomy vs. shame and doubt: the very young child; relationship between the child and parents; the struggle to stand on\n\none's own two feet, to find autonomy in the face of experiences of shame and doubt as to one's capacity for self-control.\n\n3. Initiative vs. guilt: the child; relationship to the family, the ring of friends; the search for action, and the integrity of one's acts; to make and eagerly learn, checked by the fear and guilt of one's own aggressions.\n\n4. Industry vs. inferiority: the youngster; relationship to the neighborhood, the school; adaptation to the society's tools; the sense that one can make things well, alone, and with others, against the experience of failure, inadequacy.\n\n5. Identity es. identity diffusion: youth, adolescence; relationship to peers and \"outgroups\" and the search for models of adult life; the search for continuity in one's own character against confusion and doubt; a moratorium; a time to find and ally oneself with creeds and programs of the world.\n\n6. Intimacy vs. isolation: young adults; partners in friendship, sex, work; the struggle to commit oneself concretely in relations with others; to lose and find oneself in another, against isolation .\n\nand the avoidance of others.\n\n7. Generativity vs. stagnation: adults; the relationship between a person and the division of labor, and the creation of a shared household; the struggle to establish and guide, to create, against the failure to do so, and the feelings of stagnation.\n\n8. Integrity es. despair: old age; the relationship between a person and his world, his kind, mankind; the achievement of wisdom; love for oneself and one's kind; to face death openly, with the forces of one's life integrated; vs. the despair that life has been useless.\n\n## B. But Growth Through The Life Cycle Is Not Incvitable.\n\nIt depends on the presence of a balanced community, a community that can sustain the give and take of growth. Persons at each stage of life have something irreplaceable to give and to take from the community, and it is just these transactions which help a person to solve the problems that beset each stage. Consider the case of a young couple and their new child. The connection between them is entirely mutual. Of course, the child \"depends\" on the parents to give the care and love that is required to resolve the conflict of trust that goes with infancy. But simultancously,\n\n## 1 4 2\n\nthe child gives the parents the experience of raising and bearing, which helps them to meet their conflict of generativity, unique to adulthood.\n\nWe distort the situation if we abstract it in such a way that we consider the parent as \"having\" such and such a personality when the child is born and then, remaining static, impinging upon a poor little thing. For this weak and changing little being moves the whole family along. Babies control and bring up their families as much as they are controlled by them; in fact, we may say that the family brings up a baby by being brought up by him. Whatever reaction patterns are given biologically and whatever schedule is predetermined developmentally must be considered to be a series of potentialities for changing patterns of mutual regulation. [Erikson, ibid. p. 69.]\nSimilar patterns of mutual regulation occur between the very old and the very young; between adolescents and young adults, children and infants, teenagers and younger teenagers, young men and old women, young women and old men, and so on. And these patterns must be made viable by prevailing social institutions and those parts of the environment which help to maintain them\n-the schools, nurseries, homes, cafes, bedrooms, sports fields, workshops, studios, gardens, graveyards. . . .\n\nWe believe, however, that the balance of settings which allow normal growth through the life cycle has been breaking down. Contact with the entire cycle of life is less and less available to each person, at each moment in time. In place of natural communities with a balanced life cycle we have retirement villages, bedrooms suburbs, teenage culture, ghettos of unemployed, college towns, mass cemeteries, industrial parks. Under such conditions, one's chances for solving the conflict that comes with each stage in the life cycle are slim indeed.\n\nTo re-create a community of balanced life cycles requires, first of all, that the idea take its place as a principal guide in the development of communities. Each building project, whether the addition to a house, a new road, a clinic, can be viewed as either helping or hindering the right balance for local communities. We suspect that the community repair maps, discussed in The Oregon Experiment, Chapter V (Volume 3 in this series), can play an especially useful role in helping to encourage the growth of a balanced life cycle.\n\nBut this pattern can be no more than an indication of work\n\n## 1 4 3\n\nthat needs to be done. Each community must find ways of taking stock of its own relative \"balance\" in this respect, and then define a growth process which will move it in the right direction. This is a tremendously interesting and vital problem; it needs a great deal of development, experiment, and theory. If Erikson is right, and if this kind of work does not come, it seems possible that the development of trust, autonomy, initiative, industry, identity, intimacy, generativity, integrity may disappear entirely.\n\n| STAGE                   | IMPORTANT SETTINGS         | RITES OF PASSAGE        |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|\n| I.

This book. describes the\ndetailed patterns for towns and neighborhoods, houses,\ngardens, and rooms. The other book explains the disci-\npline which makes it possible to use these patterns to\ncreate a building or a town. This book is the sourcebook of\nthe timeless way; the other is its practice and its origin.\nThe two books have evolved very much in parallel.\nThey have been growing over the last eight years, as\nwe have worked on the one hand to understand the\nnature of the building process, and on the other hand to\nconstruct an actual, possible pattern language. We have\nbeen forced by practical considerations, to publish these\ntwo books under separate covers; but in fact, they form\nan indivisible whole. It is possible to read them sepa-\nrately. But to gain the insight which we have tried to\ncommunicate in them, it is essential that you read them\nboth.\nThe Timeless Way of Building describes the funda-\nmental nature of the task of making towns and buildings.\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nIt is shown there, that towns and buildings will not be\nable to become alive, unless they are made by all the\npeople in society, and unless these people share a com-\nmon pattern language, within which to make these\nbuildings, and unless this cornmon pattern language is\nalive itself.\nTn this book, we present one possible pattern language,\nof the kind called for in The Timeless Way. This lan-\nguage is extremely practical. It is a language that we\nhave distilled from our own building and planning ef-\nforts over the last eight years. You can use it to work\nwith your neighbors, to improve your town and neighbor-\nhood. You can use it to design a house for yourself,\nwith your family; or to work with other people to de-\nsign an office or a workshop or a public building like a\nschool. And you can use it to guide you in the actual\nprocess of construction.\nThe elements of this language are entities called pat-\nterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs\nover and over again in our environment, and then\ndescribes the core of the solution to that problem, in such\na way that you can use this solution a million times over,\nwithout ever doing it the same way twice.\nFor convenience and clarity, each pattern has the same\nformat. First, there is a picture, which shows an arche-\ntypal example of that pattern. Second, after the picture,\neach pattern has an introductory paragraph, which sets\nthe context for the pattern, by explaining how it helps\nto complete certain larger patterns. Then there are three\ndiamonds to mark the beginning of the problem. After\nthe diamonds there is a headline, in bold type. This\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nheadline gives the essence of the problem in one or two\nsentences. After the headline comes the body of the\nproblem. This is the longest section. It describes the\nempirical background of the pattern, the evidence for its\nvalidity, the range of different ways the pattern can be\nmanifested in a building, and so on. Then, again in\nbold type, like the headline, is the solution—the heart\nof the pattern—which describes the field of physical and\nsocial relationships which are required to solve the stated\nproblem, in the stated context. This solution is always\nexactly what you need to do, to build the pattern. Then,\nafter the solution, there is a diagram, which shows the\nsolution in the form of a diagram, with labels to indicate\nits main components.\nAfter the diagram, another three diamonds, to show\nthat the main body of the pattern is finished. And finally,\nafter the diamonds there is a paragraph which ties the\npattern to all those smaller patterns in the language,\nwhich are needed to complete this pattern, to embellish\nit, to All it out.\nThere are two essential purposes behind this format.\nFirst, to present each pattern connected to other patterns,\nso that you grasp the collection of all 253 patterns as a\nwhole, as a language, within which you can create an in-\nfinite variety of combinations. Second, to present the\nproblem and solution of each pattern in such a way that\nyou can judge it for yourself, and modify it, without\nlosing the essence that is central to it.\nLet us next understand the nature of the connection\nbetween patterns.\nXI\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nThe patterns are ordered, beginning with the very\nlargest, for regions and towns, then working down\nthrough neighborhoods, clusters of buildings, buildings,\nrooms and alcoves, ending finally with details of con-\nstruction.\nThis order, which is presented as a straight linear\nsequerice, is essential to the way the language works. It is\npresented, and explained more fully, in the next section.\nWhat is most important about this sequence, is that it is\nbased on the connections between the patterns. Each\npattern is connected to certain “larger” patterns which\ncome above it in the language; and to certain “smaller”\npatterns which come below it in the language. The pat-\ntern helps to complete those larger patterns which are\n“above” it, and is itself completed by those smaller pat-\nterns which are “below” it.\nThus, for example, you will find that the pattern ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN (60), is connected first to certain larger\npatterns: SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY (13), IDENTIFIABLE\nNEIGHBORHOOD (14), WORK COMMUNITY (41), and\nquirr Backs (59). These appear on its first page. And it\nis also connected to certain smaller patterns: PosiTIVE\nOUTDOOR SPACE (107), TREE PLACES (171), and GARDEN\nWALL (173). These appear on its last page.\nWhat this means, is that IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBOR-\nHOOD, SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, WORK COMMUNITY, and\nQUIET BACKS are incomplete, unless they contain an ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN; and that an ACCESSIBLE GREEN is itself\nincomplete, unless it contains POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nAnd what it means in practical terms is that, if you\nx\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to lay out a green according to this pattern, you\nmust not only follow the instructions which describe the\npattern itself, but must also try to embed the green\nWithin an IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD or in some sUB-\nCULTURE BOUNDARY, and in a way that helps to form\nquizr Backs; and then you must work to complete the\ngreen by building in some posiTIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nIn short, no pattern is an isolated entity. Each pattern\ncan exist in the world, only to the extent that is sup-\nported by other patterns: the larger patterns in which it\nis embedded, the patterns of the same size that surround\nit, and the smaller patterns which are embedded in it.\nThis is a fundamental view of the world, It says that\nwhen you build a thing you cannot merely build that\nthing in isolation, but must also repair the world around\nit, and within it, so that the larger world at that one\nplace becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the\nthing which you make takes its place in the web of na-\nture, as you make it.\nNow we explain the nature of the relation between\nproblems and solutions, within the individual patterns.\nEach solution is stated in such a way that it gives the\nessential field of relationships needed to solve the prob-\nlem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you\ncan solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by\nadapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions\nat the place where you are making it.\nFor this reason, we have tried to write each solution\nin a way which imposes nothing on you. It contains only\nthose essentials which cannot be avoided if you really\nXU\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to solve the problem. In this sense, we have tried,\nin each solution, to capture the invariant property com-\nmon to all places which succeed in solving the problem.\nBut of course, we have not always succeeded. The\nsolutions we have given to these problems vary in signif-\ncance, Some are more true, more profound, more cer-\ntain, than others. To show this clearly we have marked\nevery pattern, in the text itself, with two asterisks, or one\nasterisk, or no asterisks.\nIn the patterns marked with two asterisks, we believe\nthat we have succeeded in stating a true invariant: in\nshort, that the solution we have stated summarizes a\nproperty common to all possible ways of solving the\nstated problem. In these two-asterisk cases we believe,\nin short, that it is not possible to solve the stated prob-\nlem properly, without shaping the environment in one\nway or another according to the pattern that we have\ngiven—and that, in these cases, the pattern describes\na deep and inescapable property of a well-formed en-\nvironment.\nIn the patterns marked with one asterisk, we believe\nthat we have made some progress towards identifying\nsuch an invariant: but that with careful work it will\ncertainly be possible to improve on the solution, In\nthese cases, we believe it would be wise for you to treat\nthe pattern with a certain amount of disrespect—and\nthat you seek out variants of the solution which we have\ngiven, since there are almost certainly possible ranges of\nsolutions which are not covered by what we have written.\nFinally, in the patterns without an asterisk, we are\ncertain that we have mot succeeded in defining a true\nx1V\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\ninvariant—that, on the contrary, there are certainly ways\nof solving the problem different from the one which we\nhave given. In these cases we have still stated a solution,\nin order to be concrete—to provide the reader with at\nleast one way of solving the problem-—but the task of\nfinding the true invariant, the true property which hes\nat the heart of all possible solutions to this problem, re-\nmains undone.\nWe hope, of course, that many of the people who\nread, and use this language, will try to improve these\npatterns—will put their energy to work, in this task of\nfinding more true, more profound invariants—and we\nhope that gradually these more true patterns, which are\nslowly discovered, as time goes on, will enter a common\nlanguage, which all of us can share.\nYou see then that the patterns are very much alive\nand evolving. In fact, if you like, each pattern may be\nlooked upon as a hypothesis like one of the hypotheses of\nscience. In this sense, each pattern represents our current\nbest guess as to what arrangement of the physical envi-\nronment will work to solve the problem presented. The\nempirical questions center on the problem—does it occur\nand is it felt in the way we have described it?—-and the\nsolution—-does the arrangement we propose in fact re-\nsolve the problem? And the asterisks represent our\ndegree of faith in these hypotheses. But of course, no\nmatter what the asterisks say, the patterns are still\nhypotheses, all 253 of them-—-and are therefore all\ntentative, all free to evolve under the impact of new\nexperience and observation.\nLet us finally explain the status of this language, why\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwe have called it “A Pattern Language” with the em-\nphasis on the word “A,” and how we imagine this pat-\ntern language might be related to the countless thou-\nsands of other languages we hope that people will make\nfor themselves, in the future.\nThe Timeless Way of Building says that every society\nwhich is alive and whole, will have its own unique and\ndistinct pattern language; and further, that every in-\ndividual in such a society will have a unique language,\nshared in part, but which as a totality is unique to the\nraind of the person who has it. In this sense, in a healthy\nsociety there will be as many pattern languages as there\nare people—even though these languages are shared and\nsimular,\nThe question then arises: What exactly is the status\nof this published language? In what frame of mind, and\nwith what intention, are we publishing this language\nhere? The fact that it is published as a book means that\nmany thousands of people can use it. Is it not true that\nthere is a danger that people might come to rely on this\none printed language, instead of developing their own\nlanguages, in their own minds?\nThe fact is, that we have written this book as a first\nstep in the society-wide process by which people will\ngradually become conscious of their own pattern lan-\nguages, and work to improve them. We believe, and\nhave explained in The Timeless Way of Building, that\nthe languages which people have today are so brutal, and\nso fragmented, that most people no longer have any\nlanguage to speak of at all—and what they do have is\nnot based on human, or natural considerations.\nXVI\n& PATTERN LANGUAGE\nWe have spent years trying to formulate this lan-\nguage, in the hope that when a person uses tt, he will\nbe so impressed by its power, and so joyful in its use,\nthat he will understand again, what it means to have a\nliving language of this kind. [If we only succeed in that,\nit is possible that each person may once again embark on\nthe construction and development of his own language—\nperhaps taking the language printed in this book, as a\npoint of departure.\nAnd yet, we do believe, of course, that this language\nwhich is printed here is something more than a manual,\nor a teacher, or a version of a possible pattern language.\nMany of the patterns here are archetypal—so deep, so\ndeeply rooted in the nature of things, that it seems likely\nthat they will be a part of human nature, and human ac-\ntion, as much in five hundred years, as they are today.\nWe doubt very much whether anyone could construct\na valid pattern language, in his own mind, which did\nnot include the pattern arcapes (119) for example, or\nthe pattern aLcoves (179).\nIn this sense, we have also tried to penetrate, as deep\nas we are able, into the nature of things in the environ-\nment: and hope that a great part of this language, which\nwe print here, will be a core of any sensible human pat-\ntern language, which any person constructs for himself,\nin his own mind. In this sense, at least a part of the\nlanguage we have presented here, is the archetypal core\nof all possible pattern languages, which can make people\nfeel alive and human.\nXVII\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nA pattern language has the structure of a network. This\nis explained fully in The Timeless Way of Bualdimg.\nHowever, when we use the network of a language, we\nalways use it as a sequence, going through the patterns,\nmoving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,\nalways from the ones which create structures, to the ones\nwhich then embellish those structures, and then to those\nwhich embellish the embellishments. . . .\nSince the language is in truth a network, there is no\none sequence which perfectly captures it. But the se-\nquence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the\nfull network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down,\ndips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little\nlike a needle following a tapestry.\nThe sequence of patterns is both a summary of the\nlanguage, and at the same time, an index to the patterns.\nIf you read through the sentences which connect the\ngroups of patterns to one another, you will get an over-\nview of the whole language. And once you get this over-\nview, you will then be able to find the patterns which\nare relevant to your own project.\nAnd finally, as we shall explain in the next section,\nthis sequence of patterns is also the “base map,” from\nKVL\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nwhich you can make a language for your own project,\nby choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,\nand leaving them more or less in the order that you\nfind them printed here.\nWe begin with that part of the language which defines\na town or community. These patterns can never be “de-\nsigned” or “buil?” in one fell swoop—but patient piece-\nmeal growth, designed in such a way that every indi-\nvidual act is always helping to create or generate these\nlarger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the\nyears, make a community that has these global patterns\nin tk.\nI.

They create\na coherent picture of an entire region, with the power\nto generate such regions in a million forms, with in-\nfinite variety in all the details.\nIt 1s also true that any small sequence of patterns from\nthis language is itself a language for a smaller part of\nthe environment; and this small list of patterns is then\ncapable of generating a million parks, paths, houses,\nworkshops, or gardens.\nFor example, consider the following ten patterns:\nPRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET (140)\nSUNNY PLACE (161)\nOUTDOOR ROOM (163)\nSIX-FOOT BALCONY (167)\nPATHS AND GOALS (120)\nCEILING HEIGHT VARIETY (190)\nCOLUMNS AT THE CORNERS (212)\nFRONT DOOR BENCH (242)\nRAISED FLOWERS (245)\nDIFFERENT CHAIRS (251)\nThis short list of patterns is itself a language: it is one\nof a thousand possible languages for a porch, at the front\nof a house, One of us chose this small language, to build\nAXERV\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBYJECT\na porch onto the front of his house. This is the way the\nlanguage, and its patterns, helped to generate this porch.\nI started with PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE sTREET (140). That\npattern calls for a terrace, slightly raised, connected to the house,\nand on the street side. suNNY PLACE (161) suggests that a special\nplace on the sunny side of the yard should be intensified and\nmade into a place by the use of a patio, balcony, outdoor room,\netc, | used these two patterns to locate a raised platform on the\nsouth side of the house.\nit half under the existing roof overhang, and kept a mature\npyracanthus tree right smack in the middle of the platform. The\noverhead foliage of the tree added to the roof-like enclosure of\nthe space. I put a wind screen of fixed glass on the west side of\nthe platform too, to give it even more enclosure.\nplatform. But this pattern had to be used judiciously and not\nblindly—the reasoning for the pattern has to do with the mini-\nmum space required for people to sit comfortably and carry on a\ndiscussion around a small side-table. Since 1 wanted space for at\nleast two of these conversation areas—one under the roof for very\nfeet square.\nNow PATHS AND Goats (120): Usually, this pattern deals with\nlarge paths in a neighborhood, and comes much earlier in a lan-\nguage. But I used it in a special way. It says that the paths which\nnaturally get formed by people’s walking, on the land, should be\npreserved and intensified. Since the path to our front door cut\nright across the corner of the place where 1 had planned to put\nthe platform, 1 cut the corner of the platform aff.\nThe height of the platform above the ground was determined\nby CEILING HEIGHT varieETY (190). By building the platform\napproximately one foot above the ground line, the ceiling height\nof the covered portion came out at between 6 and 7 feet——just\nright for a space as small as this. Since this height above the\nBOOR BENCH (242) was automatically satisfied.\nThere were three columns standing, supporting the roof over\nXXXVI]ground level is just about right for sitting, the pattern FRONT\nhot or rainy days, and one out under the sky for days when you\nwanted to be full in the sun, the balcony had to be made 12 x 12\nI used six-Foor BaLcony (167) to determine the size of the\nTo make this platform into an ovTsoor Room (163), I put\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nthe old porch, They had to stay where they are, because they hold\nthe roof up. But, following covumns ar THE coRNERs (212),\nthe platform was very carefully tailored to their positions—so that\nthe columns help define the social spaces on either side of them.\nFinally, we put a couple of flower boxes next to the “front door\nbench”—it’s nice to smell them when you sit there—according to\nRAISED FLowERs (245). And the old chairs you can see in the\nporch are DIeFERENT CHAIRS (251).\nYou can see, from this short example, how powerful\nand simple a pattern language is, And you are now,\nperhaps ready to appreciate how careful you must be,\nwhen you construct a language for yourself and your\nown project.\nThe character of the porch is given by the ten patterns\nin this short language. In just this way, each part of the\nenvironment is given its character by the collection of\npatterns which we choose to build into it. The character\nof what you build, will be given to it by the language of\npatterns you use, to generate it.\nXxxvii\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nFor this reason, of course, the task of choosing a lan-\nguage for your project is fundamental. The pattern lan-\nguage we have given here contains 253 patterns. You\ncan therefore use it to generate an almost unimaginably\nlarge number of possible different smaller languages,\nfor all the different projects you may choose to do,\nsimply by picking patterns from it.\nWe shall now describe a rough procedure by which\nyou can choose a language for your own project, first by\ntaking patterns from this language we have printed here,\nand then by adding patterns of your own.\nr. First of all, make a copy of the master sequence\n(pages xix-xxxiv) on which you can tick off the patterns\nwhich will form the language for your project. If you\ndon’t have access to a copying machine, you can tick off\npatterns in the list printed in the book, use paper clips\nto mark pages, write your own list, use paper markers—\nwhatever you like. But just for now, to explain it clearly,\nwe shall assume that you have a copy of the list in front\nof you.\n2. Scan down the list, and find the pattern which\nbest describes the overall scope of the project you have\nin mind, This is the starting pattern for your project.\nTick it. CIE there are two or three possible candidates,\ndon’t worry: just pick the one which seems best: the\nothers will fall in place as you move forward.)\n3. Turn to the starting pattern itself, in the book, and\nread it through. Notice that the other patterns men-\ntioned by name at the beginning and at the end, of the\npattern you are reading, are also possible candidates for\nyour language. The ones at the beginning will tend to be\n“larger” than your project. Don’t include them, unless\nXXXVI\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nyou have the power to help create these patterns, at least\nin a small way, in the world around your project. The\nones at the end are “smaller.” Almost all of them will\nbe important. Tick all of them, on your list, unless you\nhave some special reason for not wanting to include\nthem.\n4. Now your list has some more ticks on it. Turn to\nthe next highest pattern on the list which is ticked, and\nopen the book to that pattern. Once again, it will lead\nyou to other patterns. Once again, tick those which are\nrelevant—especially the ones which are “smaller” that\ncome at the end. As a general rule, do not tick the ones\nwhich are “larger” unless you can do something about\nthem, concretely, in your own project.\n5. When in doubt about a pattern, don’t include it.\nYour list can easily get too long: and if it does, it will\nbecome confusing. The list will be quite long enough,\neven if you only include the patterns you especially like.\n6. Keep going like this, until you have ticked all the\npatterns you want for your project.\n7. Now, adjust the sequence by adding your own ma-\nterial. If there are things you want to include in your\nproject, but you have not been able to find patterns which\ncorrespond to them, then write them in, at an appropri-\nate point in the sequence, near other patterns which are\nof about the same size and importance. For example,\nthere is no pattern for a sauna. If you want to include\none, write it in somewhere near BATHING ROOM (144)\nin your sequence.\n8. And of course, if you want to change any patterns,\nchange them. There are often cases where you may have\na personal version of a pattern, which is more true, or\nXXXIN\nCHOCSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nmore relevant for you. In this case, you will get the most\n“power” over the language, and make it your own most\neffectively, if you write the changes in, at the appropri-\nate places in the book. And, it will be most concrete of\nall, if you change the name of the pattern too—so that\nit captures your own changes clearly.\nyp oe\nSuppose now that you have a language for your proj-\nect. The way to use the language depends very much\non its scale. Patterns dealing with towns can only be\nimplemented gradually, by grass roots action; patterns\nfor a building can be built up in your mind, and marked\nout on the ground; patterns for construction must be\nbuilt physically, on the site. For this reason we have\ngiven three separate instructions, for these three different\nscales. For towns, see page 3; for buildings, see page\n463; for construction, see page 935.\nThe procedures for each of these three scales are de-\nscribed in much more detail with extensive examples,\nin the appropriate chapters of The Timeless Way of\nBuilding. For the town—see chapters 24 and 25; for an\nindividual building—see chapters 20, 21, and 22; and for\nthe process of construction which describes the way a\nbuilding is actually built see chapter 23.\nxh\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nFinally, a note of caution. This language, lke English,\ncan be a medium for prose, or a medium for poetry. The\ndifference between prose and poetry is not that different\nJanpuages are used, but that the same language is used,\ndifferently. In an ordinary English sentence, each word\nhas one meaning, and the sentence too, has one simple\nmeaning. In a poem, the meaning is far more dense.\nEach word carries several meanings; and the sentence\nas a Whole carries an enormous density of interlocking\nmeanings, which together illuminate the whole.\nThe same is true for pattern languages. It is possible\nto make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a\nrather loose way. A building made like this, is an as-\nsembly of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound.\nBut it 1s also possible to put patterns together in such a\nway that many many patterns overlap in the same\nphysical space: the building is very dense; it has many\nmeanings captured in a small space; and through this\ndensity, it becomes profound.\nIn a poern, this kind of density, creates illumination,\nby making identities between words, and meanings,\nwhose identity we have not understood before. In “O\nRose thou art sick,” the rose is identifed with many\nxii\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\ngreater, and more personal things than any rose—and\nthe poem illuminates the person, and the rose, because of\nthis connection. The connection not only illuminates the\nwords, but also illuminates our actual lives.\n© Rose thon art sick,\n‘The invisible worm,\nThat flies in the night\nin the howling storm:\nHas found out thy bed\nOF crimson joy:\nAnd his dark secret Jove\nDoes thy life destroy,\nWILLIAM BLAKE\nThe same exactly, happens in a building, Consider, for\nexample, the two patterns BATHING ROOM (144) and\nSTILL WATER (71). One defines a part of a house where\nyou can bathe yourself slowly, with pleasure, perhaps\nin company; a place to rest your limbs, and to relax. The\nother is a place in a neighborhood, where this is water\nto gaze into, perhaps to swim in, where children can sail\nboats, and splash about, which nourishes those parts of\nourselves which rely on water as one of the great\nelements of the unconscious.\nSuppose now, that we make a complex of buildings\nwhere individual bathing rooms are somehow connected\nto a common pond, or lake, or pool—where the bathing\nroom merges with this common place; where there is no\nsharp distinction between the individual and family pro-\ncesses of the bathing room, and the common pleasure\nof the common pool. In this place, these two patterns\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nexist in the same space; they are identified, there is a\ncompression of the two, which requires less space, and\nwhich is more profound than in a place where they are\nmerely side by side. The compression illuminates each\nof the patterns, sheds light on its meaning; and also i-\nluminates our lives, as we understand a little more about\nthe connections of our inner needs.\nBut this kind of compression is not only poetic and\nprofound. It is not only the stuff of poems and exotic\nstatements, but to some degree, the stuff of every English\nsentence. To some depree, there is compression in every\nsingle word we utter, just because each word carries the\nwhisper of the meanings of the words it is connected to.\nEven “Please pass the butter, Fred” has some compres-\nsion in it, because it carries overtones that lie in the con-\nnections of these words to all the words which came be-\nfore it.\nFach of us, talking to our friends, or to our families,\nmakes use of these compressions, which are drawn out\nfrom the connections between words which are given by\nthe language. The more we can feel all the connections\nin the language, the more rich and subtle are the things\nwe say at the most ordinary times.\nAnd once again, the same is true in building. The com-\npression of patterns into a single space, is not a poetic\nand exotic thing, kept for special buildings which are\nworks of art. It is the most ordinary economy of space. It\nis quite possible that all the patterns for a house might,\nin some form be present, and overlapping, in a simple\none-room cabin, The patterns do not need to be strung\nout, and kept separate. Every building, every room,\nxd\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nevery garden is better, when all the patterns which it\nneeds are compressed as far as it is possible for them to\nbe. The building will be cheaper; and the meanings in it\nwill be denser.\nIt is essential then, once you have learned to use the\nlanguage, that you pay attention to the possibility of\ncompressing the many patterns which you put together,\nin the smallest possible space. You may think of this\nprocess of compressing patterns, as a way to make the\ncheapest possible building which has the necessary pat-\nterns in it. It is, also, the only way of using a pattern\nlanguage to make buildings which are poems.\n","summary":"This chunk on \"Men and Women\" is part of the larger pattern language described in the book \"A Pattern Language\". It discusses the need to balance masculine and feminine elements in the design of the built environment, from the scale of individual buildings to the overall structure of a town or community.","chunk":"# 27 Men and Women\n\n![89_Image_0.Png](89_Image_0.Png)\n\n## Men And Women\n\n. . . and just as a community or neighborhood must have a proper balance of activities for people of all the different ages-\nCOMMUNITY OF 7000 (12), IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD (14),\nLIFE CYCLE (26)-so it must also adjust itself and its activities to the balance of the sexes, and provide, in equal part, the things which reflect the masculine and feminine sides of life.\n\nThe world of a town in the 1970's is split along sexual lines. Suburbs are for women, workplaces for men; kindergartens are for women, professional schools for men; supermarkets are for women, hardware stores for men.\n\nSince no aspect of life is purely masculine or purely feminine, a world in which the separation of the sexes is extreme, distorts reality, and perpetuates and solidifies the distortions. Science is dominated by a masculine, and often mechanical mentality; forcign diplomacy is governed by war, again the product of the masculine ego. Schools for young children are swayed by the world of women, as are homes. The house has become the domain of woman to such a ridiculous extreme that home builders and developers portray an image of homes which are delicate and perfectly \"nice,\" like powder rooms. The idea that such a home could be a place where things are made or vegetables grown, with sawdust around the front door, is almost inconceivable.\n\nThe pattern or patterns which could resolve these problems are, for the moment, unknown. We can hint at the kinds of buildings and land use and institutions which would bring the problem into balance. But the geometry cannot be understood until certain social facts are realized, and given their full power to influence the environment. In short, until both men and women are able to mutually influence each part of a town's life, we shall not know what kinds of physical patterns will best co-exist with this social order.\n\nTherefore:\n\nMake certain that each piece of the environment-each building, open space, neighborhood, and work community\n-is made with a blend of both men's and women's instincts. Keep this balance of masculine and feminine in mind for every project at every scale, from the kitchen to the steel mill.\n\n![91_image_0.png](91_image_0.png)\n\n中 中 中\nNo large housing areas without workshops for men; no work communities which do not provide for women with part-time jobs and child care-scATTERED work (9).

This book. describes the\ndetailed patterns for towns and neighborhoods, houses,\ngardens, and rooms. The other book explains the disci-\npline which makes it possible to use these patterns to\ncreate a building or a town. This book is the sourcebook of\nthe timeless way; the other is its practice and its origin.\nThe two books have evolved very much in parallel.\nThey have been growing over the last eight years, as\nwe have worked on the one hand to understand the\nnature of the building process, and on the other hand to\nconstruct an actual, possible pattern language. We have\nbeen forced by practical considerations, to publish these\ntwo books under separate covers; but in fact, they form\nan indivisible whole. It is possible to read them sepa-\nrately. But to gain the insight which we have tried to\ncommunicate in them, it is essential that you read them\nboth.\nThe Timeless Way of Building describes the funda-\nmental nature of the task of making towns and buildings.\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nIt is shown there, that towns and buildings will not be\nable to become alive, unless they are made by all the\npeople in society, and unless these people share a com-\nmon pattern language, within which to make these\nbuildings, and unless this cornmon pattern language is\nalive itself.\nTn this book, we present one possible pattern language,\nof the kind called for in The Timeless Way. This lan-\nguage is extremely practical. It is a language that we\nhave distilled from our own building and planning ef-\nforts over the last eight years. You can use it to work\nwith your neighbors, to improve your town and neighbor-\nhood. You can use it to design a house for yourself,\nwith your family; or to work with other people to de-\nsign an office or a workshop or a public building like a\nschool. And you can use it to guide you in the actual\nprocess of construction.\nThe elements of this language are entities called pat-\nterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs\nover and over again in our environment, and then\ndescribes the core of the solution to that problem, in such\na way that you can use this solution a million times over,\nwithout ever doing it the same way twice.\nFor convenience and clarity, each pattern has the same\nformat. First, there is a picture, which shows an arche-\ntypal example of that pattern. Second, after the picture,\neach pattern has an introductory paragraph, which sets\nthe context for the pattern, by explaining how it helps\nto complete certain larger patterns. Then there are three\ndiamonds to mark the beginning of the problem. After\nthe diamonds there is a headline, in bold type. This\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nheadline gives the essence of the problem in one or two\nsentences. After the headline comes the body of the\nproblem. This is the longest section. It describes the\nempirical background of the pattern, the evidence for its\nvalidity, the range of different ways the pattern can be\nmanifested in a building, and so on. Then, again in\nbold type, like the headline, is the solution—the heart\nof the pattern—which describes the field of physical and\nsocial relationships which are required to solve the stated\nproblem, in the stated context. This solution is always\nexactly what you need to do, to build the pattern. Then,\nafter the solution, there is a diagram, which shows the\nsolution in the form of a diagram, with labels to indicate\nits main components.\nAfter the diagram, another three diamonds, to show\nthat the main body of the pattern is finished. And finally,\nafter the diamonds there is a paragraph which ties the\npattern to all those smaller patterns in the language,\nwhich are needed to complete this pattern, to embellish\nit, to All it out.\nThere are two essential purposes behind this format.\nFirst, to present each pattern connected to other patterns,\nso that you grasp the collection of all 253 patterns as a\nwhole, as a language, within which you can create an in-\nfinite variety of combinations. Second, to present the\nproblem and solution of each pattern in such a way that\nyou can judge it for yourself, and modify it, without\nlosing the essence that is central to it.\nLet us next understand the nature of the connection\nbetween patterns.\nXI\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nThe patterns are ordered, beginning with the very\nlargest, for regions and towns, then working down\nthrough neighborhoods, clusters of buildings, buildings,\nrooms and alcoves, ending finally with details of con-\nstruction.\nThis order, which is presented as a straight linear\nsequerice, is essential to the way the language works. It is\npresented, and explained more fully, in the next section.\nWhat is most important about this sequence, is that it is\nbased on the connections between the patterns. Each\npattern is connected to certain “larger” patterns which\ncome above it in the language; and to certain “smaller”\npatterns which come below it in the language. The pat-\ntern helps to complete those larger patterns which are\n“above” it, and is itself completed by those smaller pat-\nterns which are “below” it.\nThus, for example, you will find that the pattern ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN (60), is connected first to certain larger\npatterns: SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY (13), IDENTIFIABLE\nNEIGHBORHOOD (14), WORK COMMUNITY (41), and\nquirr Backs (59). These appear on its first page. And it\nis also connected to certain smaller patterns: PosiTIVE\nOUTDOOR SPACE (107), TREE PLACES (171), and GARDEN\nWALL (173). These appear on its last page.\nWhat this means, is that IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBOR-\nHOOD, SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, WORK COMMUNITY, and\nQUIET BACKS are incomplete, unless they contain an ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN; and that an ACCESSIBLE GREEN is itself\nincomplete, unless it contains POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nAnd what it means in practical terms is that, if you\nx\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to lay out a green according to this pattern, you\nmust not only follow the instructions which describe the\npattern itself, but must also try to embed the green\nWithin an IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD or in some sUB-\nCULTURE BOUNDARY, and in a way that helps to form\nquizr Backs; and then you must work to complete the\ngreen by building in some posiTIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nIn short, no pattern is an isolated entity. Each pattern\ncan exist in the world, only to the extent that is sup-\nported by other patterns: the larger patterns in which it\nis embedded, the patterns of the same size that surround\nit, and the smaller patterns which are embedded in it.\nThis is a fundamental view of the world, It says that\nwhen you build a thing you cannot merely build that\nthing in isolation, but must also repair the world around\nit, and within it, so that the larger world at that one\nplace becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the\nthing which you make takes its place in the web of na-\nture, as you make it.\nNow we explain the nature of the relation between\nproblems and solutions, within the individual patterns.\nEach solution is stated in such a way that it gives the\nessential field of relationships needed to solve the prob-\nlem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you\ncan solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by\nadapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions\nat the place where you are making it.\nFor this reason, we have tried to write each solution\nin a way which imposes nothing on you. It contains only\nthose essentials which cannot be avoided if you really\nXU\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to solve the problem. In this sense, we have tried,\nin each solution, to capture the invariant property com-\nmon to all places which succeed in solving the problem.\nBut of course, we have not always succeeded. The\nsolutions we have given to these problems vary in signif-\ncance, Some are more true, more profound, more cer-\ntain, than others. To show this clearly we have marked\nevery pattern, in the text itself, with two asterisks, or one\nasterisk, or no asterisks.\nIn the patterns marked with two asterisks, we believe\nthat we have succeeded in stating a true invariant: in\nshort, that the solution we have stated summarizes a\nproperty common to all possible ways of solving the\nstated problem. In these two-asterisk cases we believe,\nin short, that it is not possible to solve the stated prob-\nlem properly, without shaping the environment in one\nway or another according to the pattern that we have\ngiven—and that, in these cases, the pattern describes\na deep and inescapable property of a well-formed en-\nvironment.\nIn the patterns marked with one asterisk, we believe\nthat we have made some progress towards identifying\nsuch an invariant: but that with careful work it will\ncertainly be possible to improve on the solution, In\nthese cases, we believe it would be wise for you to treat\nthe pattern with a certain amount of disrespect—and\nthat you seek out variants of the solution which we have\ngiven, since there are almost certainly possible ranges of\nsolutions which are not covered by what we have written.\nFinally, in the patterns without an asterisk, we are\ncertain that we have mot succeeded in defining a true\nx1V\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\ninvariant—that, on the contrary, there are certainly ways\nof solving the problem different from the one which we\nhave given. In these cases we have still stated a solution,\nin order to be concrete—to provide the reader with at\nleast one way of solving the problem-—but the task of\nfinding the true invariant, the true property which hes\nat the heart of all possible solutions to this problem, re-\nmains undone.\nWe hope, of course, that many of the people who\nread, and use this language, will try to improve these\npatterns—will put their energy to work, in this task of\nfinding more true, more profound invariants—and we\nhope that gradually these more true patterns, which are\nslowly discovered, as time goes on, will enter a common\nlanguage, which all of us can share.\nYou see then that the patterns are very much alive\nand evolving. In fact, if you like, each pattern may be\nlooked upon as a hypothesis like one of the hypotheses of\nscience. In this sense, each pattern represents our current\nbest guess as to what arrangement of the physical envi-\nronment will work to solve the problem presented. The\nempirical questions center on the problem—does it occur\nand is it felt in the way we have described it?—-and the\nsolution—-does the arrangement we propose in fact re-\nsolve the problem? And the asterisks represent our\ndegree of faith in these hypotheses. But of course, no\nmatter what the asterisks say, the patterns are still\nhypotheses, all 253 of them-—-and are therefore all\ntentative, all free to evolve under the impact of new\nexperience and observation.\nLet us finally explain the status of this language, why\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwe have called it “A Pattern Language” with the em-\nphasis on the word “A,” and how we imagine this pat-\ntern language might be related to the countless thou-\nsands of other languages we hope that people will make\nfor themselves, in the future.\nThe Timeless Way of Building says that every society\nwhich is alive and whole, will have its own unique and\ndistinct pattern language; and further, that every in-\ndividual in such a society will have a unique language,\nshared in part, but which as a totality is unique to the\nraind of the person who has it. In this sense, in a healthy\nsociety there will be as many pattern languages as there\nare people—even though these languages are shared and\nsimular,\nThe question then arises: What exactly is the status\nof this published language? In what frame of mind, and\nwith what intention, are we publishing this language\nhere? The fact that it is published as a book means that\nmany thousands of people can use it. Is it not true that\nthere is a danger that people might come to rely on this\none printed language, instead of developing their own\nlanguages, in their own minds?\nThe fact is, that we have written this book as a first\nstep in the society-wide process by which people will\ngradually become conscious of their own pattern lan-\nguages, and work to improve them. We believe, and\nhave explained in The Timeless Way of Building, that\nthe languages which people have today are so brutal, and\nso fragmented, that most people no longer have any\nlanguage to speak of at all—and what they do have is\nnot based on human, or natural considerations.\nXVI\n& PATTERN LANGUAGE\nWe have spent years trying to formulate this lan-\nguage, in the hope that when a person uses tt, he will\nbe so impressed by its power, and so joyful in its use,\nthat he will understand again, what it means to have a\nliving language of this kind. [If we only succeed in that,\nit is possible that each person may once again embark on\nthe construction and development of his own language—\nperhaps taking the language printed in this book, as a\npoint of departure.\nAnd yet, we do believe, of course, that this language\nwhich is printed here is something more than a manual,\nor a teacher, or a version of a possible pattern language.\nMany of the patterns here are archetypal—so deep, so\ndeeply rooted in the nature of things, that it seems likely\nthat they will be a part of human nature, and human ac-\ntion, as much in five hundred years, as they are today.\nWe doubt very much whether anyone could construct\na valid pattern language, in his own mind, which did\nnot include the pattern arcapes (119) for example, or\nthe pattern aLcoves (179).\nIn this sense, we have also tried to penetrate, as deep\nas we are able, into the nature of things in the environ-\nment: and hope that a great part of this language, which\nwe print here, will be a core of any sensible human pat-\ntern language, which any person constructs for himself,\nin his own mind. In this sense, at least a part of the\nlanguage we have presented here, is the archetypal core\nof all possible pattern languages, which can make people\nfeel alive and human.\nXVII\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nA pattern language has the structure of a network. This\nis explained fully in The Timeless Way of Bualdimg.\nHowever, when we use the network of a language, we\nalways use it as a sequence, going through the patterns,\nmoving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,\nalways from the ones which create structures, to the ones\nwhich then embellish those structures, and then to those\nwhich embellish the embellishments. . . .\nSince the language is in truth a network, there is no\none sequence which perfectly captures it. But the se-\nquence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the\nfull network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down,\ndips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little\nlike a needle following a tapestry.\nThe sequence of patterns is both a summary of the\nlanguage, and at the same time, an index to the patterns.\nIf you read through the sentences which connect the\ngroups of patterns to one another, you will get an over-\nview of the whole language. And once you get this over-\nview, you will then be able to find the patterns which\nare relevant to your own project.\nAnd finally, as we shall explain in the next section,\nthis sequence of patterns is also the “base map,” from\nKVL\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nwhich you can make a language for your own project,\nby choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,\nand leaving them more or less in the order that you\nfind them printed here.\nWe begin with that part of the language which defines\na town or community. These patterns can never be “de-\nsigned” or “buil?” in one fell swoop—but patient piece-\nmeal growth, designed in such a way that every indi-\nvidual act is always helping to create or generate these\nlarger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the\nyears, make a community that has these global patterns\nin tk.\nI.

They create\na coherent picture of an entire region, with the power\nto generate such regions in a million forms, with in-\nfinite variety in all the details.\nIt 1s also true that any small sequence of patterns from\nthis language is itself a language for a smaller part of\nthe environment; and this small list of patterns is then\ncapable of generating a million parks, paths, houses,\nworkshops, or gardens.\nFor example, consider the following ten patterns:\nPRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET (140)\nSUNNY PLACE (161)\nOUTDOOR ROOM (163)\nSIX-FOOT BALCONY (167)\nPATHS AND GOALS (120)\nCEILING HEIGHT VARIETY (190)\nCOLUMNS AT THE CORNERS (212)\nFRONT DOOR BENCH (242)\nRAISED FLOWERS (245)\nDIFFERENT CHAIRS (251)\nThis short list of patterns is itself a language: it is one\nof a thousand possible languages for a porch, at the front\nof a house, One of us chose this small language, to build\nAXERV\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBYJECT\na porch onto the front of his house. This is the way the\nlanguage, and its patterns, helped to generate this porch.\nI started with PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE sTREET (140). That\npattern calls for a terrace, slightly raised, connected to the house,\nand on the street side. suNNY PLACE (161) suggests that a special\nplace on the sunny side of the yard should be intensified and\nmade into a place by the use of a patio, balcony, outdoor room,\netc, | used these two patterns to locate a raised platform on the\nsouth side of the house.\nit half under the existing roof overhang, and kept a mature\npyracanthus tree right smack in the middle of the platform. The\noverhead foliage of the tree added to the roof-like enclosure of\nthe space. I put a wind screen of fixed glass on the west side of\nthe platform too, to give it even more enclosure.\nplatform. But this pattern had to be used judiciously and not\nblindly—the reasoning for the pattern has to do with the mini-\nmum space required for people to sit comfortably and carry on a\ndiscussion around a small side-table. Since 1 wanted space for at\nleast two of these conversation areas—one under the roof for very\nfeet square.\nNow PATHS AND Goats (120): Usually, this pattern deals with\nlarge paths in a neighborhood, and comes much earlier in a lan-\nguage. But I used it in a special way. It says that the paths which\nnaturally get formed by people’s walking, on the land, should be\npreserved and intensified. Since the path to our front door cut\nright across the corner of the place where 1 had planned to put\nthe platform, 1 cut the corner of the platform aff.\nThe height of the platform above the ground was determined\nby CEILING HEIGHT varieETY (190). By building the platform\napproximately one foot above the ground line, the ceiling height\nof the covered portion came out at between 6 and 7 feet——just\nright for a space as small as this. Since this height above the\nBOOR BENCH (242) was automatically satisfied.\nThere were three columns standing, supporting the roof over\nXXXVI]ground level is just about right for sitting, the pattern FRONT\nhot or rainy days, and one out under the sky for days when you\nwanted to be full in the sun, the balcony had to be made 12 x 12\nI used six-Foor BaLcony (167) to determine the size of the\nTo make this platform into an ovTsoor Room (163), I put\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nthe old porch, They had to stay where they are, because they hold\nthe roof up. But, following covumns ar THE coRNERs (212),\nthe platform was very carefully tailored to their positions—so that\nthe columns help define the social spaces on either side of them.\nFinally, we put a couple of flower boxes next to the “front door\nbench”—it’s nice to smell them when you sit there—according to\nRAISED FLowERs (245). And the old chairs you can see in the\nporch are DIeFERENT CHAIRS (251).\nYou can see, from this short example, how powerful\nand simple a pattern language is, And you are now,\nperhaps ready to appreciate how careful you must be,\nwhen you construct a language for yourself and your\nown project.\nThe character of the porch is given by the ten patterns\nin this short language. In just this way, each part of the\nenvironment is given its character by the collection of\npatterns which we choose to build into it. The character\nof what you build, will be given to it by the language of\npatterns you use, to generate it.\nXxxvii\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nFor this reason, of course, the task of choosing a lan-\nguage for your project is fundamental. The pattern lan-\nguage we have given here contains 253 patterns. You\ncan therefore use it to generate an almost unimaginably\nlarge number of possible different smaller languages,\nfor all the different projects you may choose to do,\nsimply by picking patterns from it.\nWe shall now describe a rough procedure by which\nyou can choose a language for your own project, first by\ntaking patterns from this language we have printed here,\nand then by adding patterns of your own.\nr. First of all, make a copy of the master sequence\n(pages xix-xxxiv) on which you can tick off the patterns\nwhich will form the language for your project. If you\ndon’t have access to a copying machine, you can tick off\npatterns in the list printed in the book, use paper clips\nto mark pages, write your own list, use paper markers—\nwhatever you like. But just for now, to explain it clearly,\nwe shall assume that you have a copy of the list in front\nof you.\n2. Scan down the list, and find the pattern which\nbest describes the overall scope of the project you have\nin mind, This is the starting pattern for your project.\nTick it. CIE there are two or three possible candidates,\ndon’t worry: just pick the one which seems best: the\nothers will fall in place as you move forward.)\n3. Turn to the starting pattern itself, in the book, and\nread it through. Notice that the other patterns men-\ntioned by name at the beginning and at the end, of the\npattern you are reading, are also possible candidates for\nyour language. The ones at the beginning will tend to be\n“larger” than your project. Don’t include them, unless\nXXXVI\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nyou have the power to help create these patterns, at least\nin a small way, in the world around your project. The\nones at the end are “smaller.” Almost all of them will\nbe important. Tick all of them, on your list, unless you\nhave some special reason for not wanting to include\nthem.\n4. Now your list has some more ticks on it. Turn to\nthe next highest pattern on the list which is ticked, and\nopen the book to that pattern. Once again, it will lead\nyou to other patterns. Once again, tick those which are\nrelevant—especially the ones which are “smaller” that\ncome at the end. As a general rule, do not tick the ones\nwhich are “larger” unless you can do something about\nthem, concretely, in your own project.\n5. When in doubt about a pattern, don’t include it.\nYour list can easily get too long: and if it does, it will\nbecome confusing. The list will be quite long enough,\neven if you only include the patterns you especially like.\n6. Keep going like this, until you have ticked all the\npatterns you want for your project.\n7. Now, adjust the sequence by adding your own ma-\nterial. If there are things you want to include in your\nproject, but you have not been able to find patterns which\ncorrespond to them, then write them in, at an appropri-\nate point in the sequence, near other patterns which are\nof about the same size and importance. For example,\nthere is no pattern for a sauna. If you want to include\none, write it in somewhere near BATHING ROOM (144)\nin your sequence.\n8. And of course, if you want to change any patterns,\nchange them. There are often cases where you may have\na personal version of a pattern, which is more true, or\nXXXIN\nCHOCSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nmore relevant for you. In this case, you will get the most\n“power” over the language, and make it your own most\neffectively, if you write the changes in, at the appropri-\nate places in the book. And, it will be most concrete of\nall, if you change the name of the pattern too—so that\nit captures your own changes clearly.\nyp oe\nSuppose now that you have a language for your proj-\nect. The way to use the language depends very much\non its scale. Patterns dealing with towns can only be\nimplemented gradually, by grass roots action; patterns\nfor a building can be built up in your mind, and marked\nout on the ground; patterns for construction must be\nbuilt physically, on the site. For this reason we have\ngiven three separate instructions, for these three different\nscales. For towns, see page 3; for buildings, see page\n463; for construction, see page 935.\nThe procedures for each of these three scales are de-\nscribed in much more detail with extensive examples,\nin the appropriate chapters of The Timeless Way of\nBuilding. For the town—see chapters 24 and 25; for an\nindividual building—see chapters 20, 21, and 22; and for\nthe process of construction which describes the way a\nbuilding is actually built see chapter 23.\nxh\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nFinally, a note of caution. This language, lke English,\ncan be a medium for prose, or a medium for poetry. The\ndifference between prose and poetry is not that different\nJanpuages are used, but that the same language is used,\ndifferently. In an ordinary English sentence, each word\nhas one meaning, and the sentence too, has one simple\nmeaning. In a poem, the meaning is far more dense.\nEach word carries several meanings; and the sentence\nas a Whole carries an enormous density of interlocking\nmeanings, which together illuminate the whole.\nThe same is true for pattern languages. It is possible\nto make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a\nrather loose way. A building made like this, is an as-\nsembly of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound.\nBut it 1s also possible to put patterns together in such a\nway that many many patterns overlap in the same\nphysical space: the building is very dense; it has many\nmeanings captured in a small space; and through this\ndensity, it becomes profound.\nIn a poern, this kind of density, creates illumination,\nby making identities between words, and meanings,\nwhose identity we have not understood before. In “O\nRose thou art sick,” the rose is identifed with many\nxii\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\ngreater, and more personal things than any rose—and\nthe poem illuminates the person, and the rose, because of\nthis connection. The connection not only illuminates the\nwords, but also illuminates our actual lives.\n© Rose thon art sick,\n‘The invisible worm,\nThat flies in the night\nin the howling storm:\nHas found out thy bed\nOF crimson joy:\nAnd his dark secret Jove\nDoes thy life destroy,\nWILLIAM BLAKE\nThe same exactly, happens in a building, Consider, for\nexample, the two patterns BATHING ROOM (144) and\nSTILL WATER (71). One defines a part of a house where\nyou can bathe yourself slowly, with pleasure, perhaps\nin company; a place to rest your limbs, and to relax. The\nother is a place in a neighborhood, where this is water\nto gaze into, perhaps to swim in, where children can sail\nboats, and splash about, which nourishes those parts of\nourselves which rely on water as one of the great\nelements of the unconscious.\nSuppose now, that we make a complex of buildings\nwhere individual bathing rooms are somehow connected\nto a common pond, or lake, or pool—where the bathing\nroom merges with this common place; where there is no\nsharp distinction between the individual and family pro-\ncesses of the bathing room, and the common pleasure\nof the common pool. In this place, these two patterns\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nexist in the same space; they are identified, there is a\ncompression of the two, which requires less space, and\nwhich is more profound than in a place where they are\nmerely side by side. The compression illuminates each\nof the patterns, sheds light on its meaning; and also i-\nluminates our lives, as we understand a little more about\nthe connections of our inner needs.\nBut this kind of compression is not only poetic and\nprofound. It is not only the stuff of poems and exotic\nstatements, but to some degree, the stuff of every English\nsentence. To some depree, there is compression in every\nsingle word we utter, just because each word carries the\nwhisper of the meanings of the words it is connected to.\nEven “Please pass the butter, Fred” has some compres-\nsion in it, because it carries overtones that lie in the con-\nnections of these words to all the words which came be-\nfore it.\nFach of us, talking to our friends, or to our families,\nmakes use of these compressions, which are drawn out\nfrom the connections between words which are given by\nthe language. The more we can feel all the connections\nin the language, the more rich and subtle are the things\nwe say at the most ordinary times.\nAnd once again, the same is true in building. The com-\npression of patterns into a single space, is not a poetic\nand exotic thing, kept for special buildings which are\nworks of art. It is the most ordinary economy of space. It\nis quite possible that all the patterns for a house might,\nin some form be present, and overlapping, in a simple\none-room cabin, The patterns do not need to be strung\nout, and kept separate. Every building, every room,\nxd\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nevery garden is better, when all the patterns which it\nneeds are compressed as far as it is possible for them to\nbe. The building will be cheaper; and the meanings in it\nwill be denser.\nIt is essential then, once you have learned to use the\nlanguage, that you pay attention to the possibility of\ncompressing the many patterns which you put together,\nin the smallest possible space. You may think of this\nprocess of compressing patterns, as a way to make the\ncheapest possible building which has the necessary pat-\nterns in it. It is, also, the only way of using a pattern\nlanguage to make buildings which are poems.\n","summary":"This chunk discusses the pattern \"Web of Public Transportation\" which is part of the larger pattern language for designing towns and communities. It describes the importance of interconnected public transportation systems and proposes a decentralized approach to managing transportation interchanges.","chunk":"# 16 Web Of Public Transportation*\n\n. . . the city, as defined by CITY COUNTRY FINGERS (3), spreads out in ribbon fashion, throughout the countryside, and is broken into LOCAL TRANSPORT AREAS (II). To connect the transport areas, and to maintain the flow of people and goods along the fingers of the cities, it is now necessary to create a web of public tranportation.\n\n## 이 수 있\n\nThe system of public transportation-the entire web of airplanes, helicopters, hovercraft, trains, boats, ferries, buses, taxis, mini-trains, carts, ski-lifts, moving sidewalks -can only work if all the parts are well connected. But they usually aren't, because the different agencies in charge of various forms of public transportation have no incentives to connect to one another.\n\nHere, in brief, is the general public transportation problem. A.\n\ncity contains a great number of places, distributed rather evenly across a two-dimensional sheet. The trips people want to make are typically between two points at random in this sheet. No one:\nlinear system (like a train system), can give direct connections between the vast possible number of point pairs in the city.\n\nIt is therefore only possible for systems of public transportation to work, if there are rich connections between a great variety of different systems. But these connections are not workable, unless they are genuine fast, short, connections. The waiting time for a connection must be short. And the walking distance between. the two connecting systems must be very short.\n\nThis much is obvious; and everyone who has thought about public transportation recognizes its importance. However, obvious though it is, it is extremely hard to implement.\n\nThere are two practical difficulties, both of which stem from the fact that different kinds of public transportation are usually in the hands of different agencies who are reluctant to cooperate.\n\nThey are reluctant to cooperate, partly because they are actually in competition, and partly just because cooperation makes life harder for them.\n\nThis is particularly true along commuting corridors. Trains, buses, mini-buses, rapid transit, ferries, and maybe even planes and helicopters compete for the same passenger market along these corridors. When each mode is operated by an independent agency there is no particular incentive to provide feeder services to the more inflexible modes. Many services are even reluctant to provide good feeder connections to rapid transit, trains, and ferries, because their commuter lines are their most lucrative lines. Similarly, in many cities of the developing world, minibuses and collectivos provide public transportation along the main commuting corridors, pulling passengers away from buses.\n\nThis leaves the mainlines served by small vehicles, while almost empty buses reach the peripheral lines, usually because the public bus company is required to serve these areas, even at a loss.\n\nThe solution to the web of public transportation, then, hinges on the possibility of solving the coordination problem of the different systems. This is the nut of the matter. We shall now propose a way of solving it. The traditional way of looking at public transportation assumes that lines are primary and that the interchanges needed to connect the lines to one another are secondary. We propose the opposite: namely, that interchanges are primary and that the transport lines are secondary elements which connect the interchanges.\n\nImagine the following organization: each interchange is run by the community that uses it. The community appoints an interchange chief for every interchange, and gives him a budget, and a directive on service. The interchange chief coordinates the service at his interchange; he charters service from any number of transport companies-the companies, themselves, are in free competition with one another to create service.\n\nIn this scheme, responsibility for public transportation shifts from lines to interchanges. The interchanges are responsible for connecting themselves to each other, and the community which\n\n## ે રે\n\nuses the interchange decides what kinds of service they want to have passing through it. It is then up to the interchange chief to persuade these transport modes to pass through it.\n\nSlowly, a service connecting interchanges will build up. One example which closely follows our model, and shows that this model is capable of producing a higher level of service than any centralized agency can produce, is the famous Swiss Railway System.\n\nThe Swiss railway system . . . is the densest network in the world. At great cost and with great trouble, it has been made to serve the needs of the smallest localities and most remote valleys, not as a paying proposition but because such was the will of the people. It is the outcome of fierce political struggles. In the 19th century, the\n\"democratic railway movement\" brought the small Swiss communities into conflict with the big towns, which had plans for centralisation. . . . And if we compare the Swiss system with the French which, with admirable geometrical regularity, is entirely centered on Paris so that the prosperities or the decline, the life or death of whole regions has depended on the quality of the link with the capital, we see the difference between a centralised state and a federal alliance.\n\nThe railway map is the easiest to read at a glance, but let us now superimpose on it another showing economic activity and the movement of population. The distribution of industrial activity all over Switzerland, even in the outlying areas, accounts for the strength and stability of the social structure of the country and prevented those horrible 19th century concentrations of industry, with their slums and rootless proletariat. (Colin Ward, \"The Organization of Anarchy,\"\nin Patterns of Anarchy, by Leonard I. Krimerman and Lewis Perry, New York, 1966.)\nTherefore:\nTreat interchanges as primary and transportation lines as secondary. Create incentives so that all the different modes of public transportation-airplanes, helicopters, ferries, boats, trains, rapid transit, buses, mini-buses, skilifts, escalators, travelators, elevators-plan their lines to connect the interchanges, with the hope that gradually many different lines, of many different types, will meet at every interchange.\n\nGive the local communities control over their interchanges so that they can implement the pattern by giving \n\ncontracts only to those transportation companies which are willing to serve these interchanges.\n\n![38_image_0.png](38_image_0.png)\n\n中 中 中\nKeep all the various lines that converge on a single interchange, and their parking, within 600 feet, so that people can transfer on foot-INTERCHANGE (34).

This book. describes the\ndetailed patterns for towns and neighborhoods, houses,\ngardens, and rooms. The other book explains the disci-\npline which makes it possible to use these patterns to\ncreate a building or a town. This book is the sourcebook of\nthe timeless way; the other is its practice and its origin.\nThe two books have evolved very much in parallel.\nThey have been growing over the last eight years, as\nwe have worked on the one hand to understand the\nnature of the building process, and on the other hand to\nconstruct an actual, possible pattern language. We have\nbeen forced by practical considerations, to publish these\ntwo books under separate covers; but in fact, they form\nan indivisible whole. It is possible to read them sepa-\nrately. But to gain the insight which we have tried to\ncommunicate in them, it is essential that you read them\nboth.\nThe Timeless Way of Building describes the funda-\nmental nature of the task of making towns and buildings.\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nIt is shown there, that towns and buildings will not be\nable to become alive, unless they are made by all the\npeople in society, and unless these people share a com-\nmon pattern language, within which to make these\nbuildings, and unless this cornmon pattern language is\nalive itself.\nTn this book, we present one possible pattern language,\nof the kind called for in The Timeless Way. This lan-\nguage is extremely practical. It is a language that we\nhave distilled from our own building and planning ef-\nforts over the last eight years. You can use it to work\nwith your neighbors, to improve your town and neighbor-\nhood. You can use it to design a house for yourself,\nwith your family; or to work with other people to de-\nsign an office or a workshop or a public building like a\nschool. And you can use it to guide you in the actual\nprocess of construction.\nThe elements of this language are entities called pat-\nterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs\nover and over again in our environment, and then\ndescribes the core of the solution to that problem, in such\na way that you can use this solution a million times over,\nwithout ever doing it the same way twice.\nFor convenience and clarity, each pattern has the same\nformat. First, there is a picture, which shows an arche-\ntypal example of that pattern. Second, after the picture,\neach pattern has an introductory paragraph, which sets\nthe context for the pattern, by explaining how it helps\nto complete certain larger patterns. Then there are three\ndiamonds to mark the beginning of the problem. After\nthe diamonds there is a headline, in bold type. This\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nheadline gives the essence of the problem in one or two\nsentences. After the headline comes the body of the\nproblem. This is the longest section. It describes the\nempirical background of the pattern, the evidence for its\nvalidity, the range of different ways the pattern can be\nmanifested in a building, and so on. Then, again in\nbold type, like the headline, is the solution—the heart\nof the pattern—which describes the field of physical and\nsocial relationships which are required to solve the stated\nproblem, in the stated context. This solution is always\nexactly what you need to do, to build the pattern. Then,\nafter the solution, there is a diagram, which shows the\nsolution in the form of a diagram, with labels to indicate\nits main components.\nAfter the diagram, another three diamonds, to show\nthat the main body of the pattern is finished. And finally,\nafter the diamonds there is a paragraph which ties the\npattern to all those smaller patterns in the language,\nwhich are needed to complete this pattern, to embellish\nit, to All it out.\nThere are two essential purposes behind this format.\nFirst, to present each pattern connected to other patterns,\nso that you grasp the collection of all 253 patterns as a\nwhole, as a language, within which you can create an in-\nfinite variety of combinations. Second, to present the\nproblem and solution of each pattern in such a way that\nyou can judge it for yourself, and modify it, without\nlosing the essence that is central to it.\nLet us next understand the nature of the connection\nbetween patterns.\nXI\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nThe patterns are ordered, beginning with the very\nlargest, for regions and towns, then working down\nthrough neighborhoods, clusters of buildings, buildings,\nrooms and alcoves, ending finally with details of con-\nstruction.\nThis order, which is presented as a straight linear\nsequerice, is essential to the way the language works. It is\npresented, and explained more fully, in the next section.\nWhat is most important about this sequence, is that it is\nbased on the connections between the patterns. Each\npattern is connected to certain “larger” patterns which\ncome above it in the language; and to certain “smaller”\npatterns which come below it in the language. The pat-\ntern helps to complete those larger patterns which are\n“above” it, and is itself completed by those smaller pat-\nterns which are “below” it.\nThus, for example, you will find that the pattern ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN (60), is connected first to certain larger\npatterns: SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY (13), IDENTIFIABLE\nNEIGHBORHOOD (14), WORK COMMUNITY (41), and\nquirr Backs (59). These appear on its first page. And it\nis also connected to certain smaller patterns: PosiTIVE\nOUTDOOR SPACE (107), TREE PLACES (171), and GARDEN\nWALL (173). These appear on its last page.\nWhat this means, is that IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBOR-\nHOOD, SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, WORK COMMUNITY, and\nQUIET BACKS are incomplete, unless they contain an ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN; and that an ACCESSIBLE GREEN is itself\nincomplete, unless it contains POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nAnd what it means in practical terms is that, if you\nx\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to lay out a green according to this pattern, you\nmust not only follow the instructions which describe the\npattern itself, but must also try to embed the green\nWithin an IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD or in some sUB-\nCULTURE BOUNDARY, and in a way that helps to form\nquizr Backs; and then you must work to complete the\ngreen by building in some posiTIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nIn short, no pattern is an isolated entity. Each pattern\ncan exist in the world, only to the extent that is sup-\nported by other patterns: the larger patterns in which it\nis embedded, the patterns of the same size that surround\nit, and the smaller patterns which are embedded in it.\nThis is a fundamental view of the world, It says that\nwhen you build a thing you cannot merely build that\nthing in isolation, but must also repair the world around\nit, and within it, so that the larger world at that one\nplace becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the\nthing which you make takes its place in the web of na-\nture, as you make it.\nNow we explain the nature of the relation between\nproblems and solutions, within the individual patterns.\nEach solution is stated in such a way that it gives the\nessential field of relationships needed to solve the prob-\nlem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you\ncan solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by\nadapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions\nat the place where you are making it.\nFor this reason, we have tried to write each solution\nin a way which imposes nothing on you. It contains only\nthose essentials which cannot be avoided if you really\nXU\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to solve the problem. In this sense, we have tried,\nin each solution, to capture the invariant property com-\nmon to all places which succeed in solving the problem.\nBut of course, we have not always succeeded. The\nsolutions we have given to these problems vary in signif-\ncance, Some are more true, more profound, more cer-\ntain, than others. To show this clearly we have marked\nevery pattern, in the text itself, with two asterisks, or one\nasterisk, or no asterisks.\nIn the patterns marked with two asterisks, we believe\nthat we have succeeded in stating a true invariant: in\nshort, that the solution we have stated summarizes a\nproperty common to all possible ways of solving the\nstated problem. In these two-asterisk cases we believe,\nin short, that it is not possible to solve the stated prob-\nlem properly, without shaping the environment in one\nway or another according to the pattern that we have\ngiven—and that, in these cases, the pattern describes\na deep and inescapable property of a well-formed en-\nvironment.\nIn the patterns marked with one asterisk, we believe\nthat we have made some progress towards identifying\nsuch an invariant: but that with careful work it will\ncertainly be possible to improve on the solution, In\nthese cases, we believe it would be wise for you to treat\nthe pattern with a certain amount of disrespect—and\nthat you seek out variants of the solution which we have\ngiven, since there are almost certainly possible ranges of\nsolutions which are not covered by what we have written.\nFinally, in the patterns without an asterisk, we are\ncertain that we have mot succeeded in defining a true\nx1V\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\ninvariant—that, on the contrary, there are certainly ways\nof solving the problem different from the one which we\nhave given. In these cases we have still stated a solution,\nin order to be concrete—to provide the reader with at\nleast one way of solving the problem-—but the task of\nfinding the true invariant, the true property which hes\nat the heart of all possible solutions to this problem, re-\nmains undone.\nWe hope, of course, that many of the people who\nread, and use this language, will try to improve these\npatterns—will put their energy to work, in this task of\nfinding more true, more profound invariants—and we\nhope that gradually these more true patterns, which are\nslowly discovered, as time goes on, will enter a common\nlanguage, which all of us can share.\nYou see then that the patterns are very much alive\nand evolving. In fact, if you like, each pattern may be\nlooked upon as a hypothesis like one of the hypotheses of\nscience. In this sense, each pattern represents our current\nbest guess as to what arrangement of the physical envi-\nronment will work to solve the problem presented. The\nempirical questions center on the problem—does it occur\nand is it felt in the way we have described it?—-and the\nsolution—-does the arrangement we propose in fact re-\nsolve the problem? And the asterisks represent our\ndegree of faith in these hypotheses. But of course, no\nmatter what the asterisks say, the patterns are still\nhypotheses, all 253 of them-—-and are therefore all\ntentative, all free to evolve under the impact of new\nexperience and observation.\nLet us finally explain the status of this language, why\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwe have called it “A Pattern Language” with the em-\nphasis on the word “A,” and how we imagine this pat-\ntern language might be related to the countless thou-\nsands of other languages we hope that people will make\nfor themselves, in the future.\nThe Timeless Way of Building says that every society\nwhich is alive and whole, will have its own unique and\ndistinct pattern language; and further, that every in-\ndividual in such a society will have a unique language,\nshared in part, but which as a totality is unique to the\nraind of the person who has it. In this sense, in a healthy\nsociety there will be as many pattern languages as there\nare people—even though these languages are shared and\nsimular,\nThe question then arises: What exactly is the status\nof this published language? In what frame of mind, and\nwith what intention, are we publishing this language\nhere? The fact that it is published as a book means that\nmany thousands of people can use it. Is it not true that\nthere is a danger that people might come to rely on this\none printed language, instead of developing their own\nlanguages, in their own minds?\nThe fact is, that we have written this book as a first\nstep in the society-wide process by which people will\ngradually become conscious of their own pattern lan-\nguages, and work to improve them. We believe, and\nhave explained in The Timeless Way of Building, that\nthe languages which people have today are so brutal, and\nso fragmented, that most people no longer have any\nlanguage to speak of at all—and what they do have is\nnot based on human, or natural considerations.\nXVI\n& PATTERN LANGUAGE\nWe have spent years trying to formulate this lan-\nguage, in the hope that when a person uses tt, he will\nbe so impressed by its power, and so joyful in its use,\nthat he will understand again, what it means to have a\nliving language of this kind. [If we only succeed in that,\nit is possible that each person may once again embark on\nthe construction and development of his own language—\nperhaps taking the language printed in this book, as a\npoint of departure.\nAnd yet, we do believe, of course, that this language\nwhich is printed here is something more than a manual,\nor a teacher, or a version of a possible pattern language.\nMany of the patterns here are archetypal—so deep, so\ndeeply rooted in the nature of things, that it seems likely\nthat they will be a part of human nature, and human ac-\ntion, as much in five hundred years, as they are today.\nWe doubt very much whether anyone could construct\na valid pattern language, in his own mind, which did\nnot include the pattern arcapes (119) for example, or\nthe pattern aLcoves (179).\nIn this sense, we have also tried to penetrate, as deep\nas we are able, into the nature of things in the environ-\nment: and hope that a great part of this language, which\nwe print here, will be a core of any sensible human pat-\ntern language, which any person constructs for himself,\nin his own mind. In this sense, at least a part of the\nlanguage we have presented here, is the archetypal core\nof all possible pattern languages, which can make people\nfeel alive and human.\nXVII\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nA pattern language has the structure of a network. This\nis explained fully in The Timeless Way of Bualdimg.\nHowever, when we use the network of a language, we\nalways use it as a sequence, going through the patterns,\nmoving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,\nalways from the ones which create structures, to the ones\nwhich then embellish those structures, and then to those\nwhich embellish the embellishments. . . .\nSince the language is in truth a network, there is no\none sequence which perfectly captures it. But the se-\nquence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the\nfull network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down,\ndips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little\nlike a needle following a tapestry.\nThe sequence of patterns is both a summary of the\nlanguage, and at the same time, an index to the patterns.\nIf you read through the sentences which connect the\ngroups of patterns to one another, you will get an over-\nview of the whole language. And once you get this over-\nview, you will then be able to find the patterns which\nare relevant to your own project.\nAnd finally, as we shall explain in the next section,\nthis sequence of patterns is also the “base map,” from\nKVL\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nwhich you can make a language for your own project,\nby choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,\nand leaving them more or less in the order that you\nfind them printed here.\nWe begin with that part of the language which defines\na town or community. These patterns can never be “de-\nsigned” or “buil?” in one fell swoop—but patient piece-\nmeal growth, designed in such a way that every indi-\nvidual act is always helping to create or generate these\nlarger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the\nyears, make a community that has these global patterns\nin tk.\nI.

They create\na coherent picture of an entire region, with the power\nto generate such regions in a million forms, with in-\nfinite variety in all the details.\nIt 1s also true that any small sequence of patterns from\nthis language is itself a language for a smaller part of\nthe environment; and this small list of patterns is then\ncapable of generating a million parks, paths, houses,\nworkshops, or gardens.\nFor example, consider the following ten patterns:\nPRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET (140)\nSUNNY PLACE (161)\nOUTDOOR ROOM (163)\nSIX-FOOT BALCONY (167)\nPATHS AND GOALS (120)\nCEILING HEIGHT VARIETY (190)\nCOLUMNS AT THE CORNERS (212)\nFRONT DOOR BENCH (242)\nRAISED FLOWERS (245)\nDIFFERENT CHAIRS (251)\nThis short list of patterns is itself a language: it is one\nof a thousand possible languages for a porch, at the front\nof a house, One of us chose this small language, to build\nAXERV\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBYJECT\na porch onto the front of his house. This is the way the\nlanguage, and its patterns, helped to generate this porch.\nI started with PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE sTREET (140). That\npattern calls for a terrace, slightly raised, connected to the house,\nand on the street side. suNNY PLACE (161) suggests that a special\nplace on the sunny side of the yard should be intensified and\nmade into a place by the use of a patio, balcony, outdoor room,\netc, | used these two patterns to locate a raised platform on the\nsouth side of the house.\nit half under the existing roof overhang, and kept a mature\npyracanthus tree right smack in the middle of the platform. The\noverhead foliage of the tree added to the roof-like enclosure of\nthe space. I put a wind screen of fixed glass on the west side of\nthe platform too, to give it even more enclosure.\nplatform. But this pattern had to be used judiciously and not\nblindly—the reasoning for the pattern has to do with the mini-\nmum space required for people to sit comfortably and carry on a\ndiscussion around a small side-table. Since 1 wanted space for at\nleast two of these conversation areas—one under the roof for very\nfeet square.\nNow PATHS AND Goats (120): Usually, this pattern deals with\nlarge paths in a neighborhood, and comes much earlier in a lan-\nguage. But I used it in a special way. It says that the paths which\nnaturally get formed by people’s walking, on the land, should be\npreserved and intensified. Since the path to our front door cut\nright across the corner of the place where 1 had planned to put\nthe platform, 1 cut the corner of the platform aff.\nThe height of the platform above the ground was determined\nby CEILING HEIGHT varieETY (190). By building the platform\napproximately one foot above the ground line, the ceiling height\nof the covered portion came out at between 6 and 7 feet——just\nright for a space as small as this. Since this height above the\nBOOR BENCH (242) was automatically satisfied.\nThere were three columns standing, supporting the roof over\nXXXVI]ground level is just about right for sitting, the pattern FRONT\nhot or rainy days, and one out under the sky for days when you\nwanted to be full in the sun, the balcony had to be made 12 x 12\nI used six-Foor BaLcony (167) to determine the size of the\nTo make this platform into an ovTsoor Room (163), I put\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nthe old porch, They had to stay where they are, because they hold\nthe roof up. But, following covumns ar THE coRNERs (212),\nthe platform was very carefully tailored to their positions—so that\nthe columns help define the social spaces on either side of them.\nFinally, we put a couple of flower boxes next to the “front door\nbench”—it’s nice to smell them when you sit there—according to\nRAISED FLowERs (245). And the old chairs you can see in the\nporch are DIeFERENT CHAIRS (251).\nYou can see, from this short example, how powerful\nand simple a pattern language is, And you are now,\nperhaps ready to appreciate how careful you must be,\nwhen you construct a language for yourself and your\nown project.\nThe character of the porch is given by the ten patterns\nin this short language. In just this way, each part of the\nenvironment is given its character by the collection of\npatterns which we choose to build into it. The character\nof what you build, will be given to it by the language of\npatterns you use, to generate it.\nXxxvii\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nFor this reason, of course, the task of choosing a lan-\nguage for your project is fundamental. The pattern lan-\nguage we have given here contains 253 patterns. You\ncan therefore use it to generate an almost unimaginably\nlarge number of possible different smaller languages,\nfor all the different projects you may choose to do,\nsimply by picking patterns from it.\nWe shall now describe a rough procedure by which\nyou can choose a language for your own project, first by\ntaking patterns from this language we have printed here,\nand then by adding patterns of your own.\nr. First of all, make a copy of the master sequence\n(pages xix-xxxiv) on which you can tick off the patterns\nwhich will form the language for your project. If you\ndon’t have access to a copying machine, you can tick off\npatterns in the list printed in the book, use paper clips\nto mark pages, write your own list, use paper markers—\nwhatever you like. But just for now, to explain it clearly,\nwe shall assume that you have a copy of the list in front\nof you.\n2. Scan down the list, and find the pattern which\nbest describes the overall scope of the project you have\nin mind, This is the starting pattern for your project.\nTick it. CIE there are two or three possible candidates,\ndon’t worry: just pick the one which seems best: the\nothers will fall in place as you move forward.)\n3. Turn to the starting pattern itself, in the book, and\nread it through. Notice that the other patterns men-\ntioned by name at the beginning and at the end, of the\npattern you are reading, are also possible candidates for\nyour language. The ones at the beginning will tend to be\n“larger” than your project. Don’t include them, unless\nXXXVI\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nyou have the power to help create these patterns, at least\nin a small way, in the world around your project. The\nones at the end are “smaller.” Almost all of them will\nbe important. Tick all of them, on your list, unless you\nhave some special reason for not wanting to include\nthem.\n4. Now your list has some more ticks on it. Turn to\nthe next highest pattern on the list which is ticked, and\nopen the book to that pattern. Once again, it will lead\nyou to other patterns. Once again, tick those which are\nrelevant—especially the ones which are “smaller” that\ncome at the end. As a general rule, do not tick the ones\nwhich are “larger” unless you can do something about\nthem, concretely, in your own project.\n5. When in doubt about a pattern, don’t include it.\nYour list can easily get too long: and if it does, it will\nbecome confusing. The list will be quite long enough,\neven if you only include the patterns you especially like.\n6. Keep going like this, until you have ticked all the\npatterns you want for your project.\n7. Now, adjust the sequence by adding your own ma-\nterial. If there are things you want to include in your\nproject, but you have not been able to find patterns which\ncorrespond to them, then write them in, at an appropri-\nate point in the sequence, near other patterns which are\nof about the same size and importance. For example,\nthere is no pattern for a sauna. If you want to include\none, write it in somewhere near BATHING ROOM (144)\nin your sequence.\n8. And of course, if you want to change any patterns,\nchange them. There are often cases where you may have\na personal version of a pattern, which is more true, or\nXXXIN\nCHOCSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nmore relevant for you. In this case, you will get the most\n“power” over the language, and make it your own most\neffectively, if you write the changes in, at the appropri-\nate places in the book. And, it will be most concrete of\nall, if you change the name of the pattern too—so that\nit captures your own changes clearly.\nyp oe\nSuppose now that you have a language for your proj-\nect. The way to use the language depends very much\non its scale. Patterns dealing with towns can only be\nimplemented gradually, by grass roots action; patterns\nfor a building can be built up in your mind, and marked\nout on the ground; patterns for construction must be\nbuilt physically, on the site. For this reason we have\ngiven three separate instructions, for these three different\nscales. For towns, see page 3; for buildings, see page\n463; for construction, see page 935.\nThe procedures for each of these three scales are de-\nscribed in much more detail with extensive examples,\nin the appropriate chapters of The Timeless Way of\nBuilding. For the town—see chapters 24 and 25; for an\nindividual building—see chapters 20, 21, and 22; and for\nthe process of construction which describes the way a\nbuilding is actually built see chapter 23.\nxh\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nFinally, a note of caution. This language, lke English,\ncan be a medium for prose, or a medium for poetry. The\ndifference between prose and poetry is not that different\nJanpuages are used, but that the same language is used,\ndifferently. In an ordinary English sentence, each word\nhas one meaning, and the sentence too, has one simple\nmeaning. In a poem, the meaning is far more dense.\nEach word carries several meanings; and the sentence\nas a Whole carries an enormous density of interlocking\nmeanings, which together illuminate the whole.\nThe same is true for pattern languages. It is possible\nto make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a\nrather loose way. A building made like this, is an as-\nsembly of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound.\nBut it 1s also possible to put patterns together in such a\nway that many many patterns overlap in the same\nphysical space: the building is very dense; it has many\nmeanings captured in a small space; and through this\ndensity, it becomes profound.\nIn a poern, this kind of density, creates illumination,\nby making identities between words, and meanings,\nwhose identity we have not understood before. In “O\nRose thou art sick,” the rose is identifed with many\nxii\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\ngreater, and more personal things than any rose—and\nthe poem illuminates the person, and the rose, because of\nthis connection. The connection not only illuminates the\nwords, but also illuminates our actual lives.\n© Rose thon art sick,\n‘The invisible worm,\nThat flies in the night\nin the howling storm:\nHas found out thy bed\nOF crimson joy:\nAnd his dark secret Jove\nDoes thy life destroy,\nWILLIAM BLAKE\nThe same exactly, happens in a building, Consider, for\nexample, the two patterns BATHING ROOM (144) and\nSTILL WATER (71). One defines a part of a house where\nyou can bathe yourself slowly, with pleasure, perhaps\nin company; a place to rest your limbs, and to relax. The\nother is a place in a neighborhood, where this is water\nto gaze into, perhaps to swim in, where children can sail\nboats, and splash about, which nourishes those parts of\nourselves which rely on water as one of the great\nelements of the unconscious.\nSuppose now, that we make a complex of buildings\nwhere individual bathing rooms are somehow connected\nto a common pond, or lake, or pool—where the bathing\nroom merges with this common place; where there is no\nsharp distinction between the individual and family pro-\ncesses of the bathing room, and the common pleasure\nof the common pool. In this place, these two patterns\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nexist in the same space; they are identified, there is a\ncompression of the two, which requires less space, and\nwhich is more profound than in a place where they are\nmerely side by side. The compression illuminates each\nof the patterns, sheds light on its meaning; and also i-\nluminates our lives, as we understand a little more about\nthe connections of our inner needs.\nBut this kind of compression is not only poetic and\nprofound. It is not only the stuff of poems and exotic\nstatements, but to some degree, the stuff of every English\nsentence. To some depree, there is compression in every\nsingle word we utter, just because each word carries the\nwhisper of the meanings of the words it is connected to.\nEven “Please pass the butter, Fred” has some compres-\nsion in it, because it carries overtones that lie in the con-\nnections of these words to all the words which came be-\nfore it.\nFach of us, talking to our friends, or to our families,\nmakes use of these compressions, which are drawn out\nfrom the connections between words which are given by\nthe language. The more we can feel all the connections\nin the language, the more rich and subtle are the things\nwe say at the most ordinary times.\nAnd once again, the same is true in building. The com-\npression of patterns into a single space, is not a poetic\nand exotic thing, kept for special buildings which are\nworks of art. It is the most ordinary economy of space. It\nis quite possible that all the patterns for a house might,\nin some form be present, and overlapping, in a simple\none-room cabin, The patterns do not need to be strung\nout, and kept separate. Every building, every room,\nxd\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nevery garden is better, when all the patterns which it\nneeds are compressed as far as it is possible for them to\nbe. The building will be cheaper; and the meanings in it\nwill be denser.\nIt is essential then, once you have learned to use the\nlanguage, that you pay attention to the possibility of\ncompressing the many patterns which you put together,\nin the smallest possible space. You may think of this\nprocess of compressing patterns, as a way to make the\ncheapest possible building which has the necessary pat-\nterns in it. It is, also, the only way of using a pattern\nlanguage to make buildings which are poems.\n","summary":"This chunk discusses the pattern \"Density Rings\" which is part of a larger pattern language for designing towns and neighborhoods. It is situated within the section of the document that describes patterns for establishing local centers and organizing housing and work communities around them.","chunk":"# 29 Density Rings*\n\n. . . in ECCENTRIC NUCLEUS (28) we have given a general form for the configuration of density \"peaks\" and \"valleys,\" with respect to the MOSAIC of SUBCULTURES (8) and sUBCULTURE\nBOUNDARIES (13). Suppose now that the center of commercial activity in a community or 7000 (12) is placed according to the prescriptions of ECCENTRIC NUCLEUS (28), and according to the overall density within the region. We then face the problem of establishing local densities, for house clusters and work communities, at different distances around this peak. This pattern gives a rule for working out the gradient of these local densities. Most concretely, this gradient of density can be specified, by drawing rings at different distances from the main center of activity and then assigning different densities to each ring, so that the densities in the succeeding rings create the gradient of density. The gradient will vary from community to communityboth according to a community's position in the region, and according to the cultural background of the people.\n\nPeople want to be close to shops and services, for excitement and convenience. And they want to be away from services, for quiet and green. The exact balance of these two desires varies from person to person, but in the aggregate it is the balance of these two desires which determines the gradient of housing densities in a neighborhood.\n\nIn order to be precise about the gradient of housing densities, let us agree at once, to analyze the densities by means of three concentric semi-circular rings, of equal radial thickness, around the main center of activity.

This book. describes the\ndetailed patterns for towns and neighborhoods, houses,\ngardens, and rooms. The other book explains the disci-\npline which makes it possible to use these patterns to\ncreate a building or a town. This book is the sourcebook of\nthe timeless way; the other is its practice and its origin.\nThe two books have evolved very much in parallel.\nThey have been growing over the last eight years, as\nwe have worked on the one hand to understand the\nnature of the building process, and on the other hand to\nconstruct an actual, possible pattern language. We have\nbeen forced by practical considerations, to publish these\ntwo books under separate covers; but in fact, they form\nan indivisible whole. It is possible to read them sepa-\nrately. But to gain the insight which we have tried to\ncommunicate in them, it is essential that you read them\nboth.\nThe Timeless Way of Building describes the funda-\nmental nature of the task of making towns and buildings.\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nIt is shown there, that towns and buildings will not be\nable to become alive, unless they are made by all the\npeople in society, and unless these people share a com-\nmon pattern language, within which to make these\nbuildings, and unless this cornmon pattern language is\nalive itself.\nTn this book, we present one possible pattern language,\nof the kind called for in The Timeless Way. This lan-\nguage is extremely practical. It is a language that we\nhave distilled from our own building and planning ef-\nforts over the last eight years. You can use it to work\nwith your neighbors, to improve your town and neighbor-\nhood. You can use it to design a house for yourself,\nwith your family; or to work with other people to de-\nsign an office or a workshop or a public building like a\nschool. And you can use it to guide you in the actual\nprocess of construction.\nThe elements of this language are entities called pat-\nterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs\nover and over again in our environment, and then\ndescribes the core of the solution to that problem, in such\na way that you can use this solution a million times over,\nwithout ever doing it the same way twice.\nFor convenience and clarity, each pattern has the same\nformat. First, there is a picture, which shows an arche-\ntypal example of that pattern. Second, after the picture,\neach pattern has an introductory paragraph, which sets\nthe context for the pattern, by explaining how it helps\nto complete certain larger patterns. Then there are three\ndiamonds to mark the beginning of the problem. After\nthe diamonds there is a headline, in bold type. This\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nheadline gives the essence of the problem in one or two\nsentences. After the headline comes the body of the\nproblem. This is the longest section. It describes the\nempirical background of the pattern, the evidence for its\nvalidity, the range of different ways the pattern can be\nmanifested in a building, and so on. Then, again in\nbold type, like the headline, is the solution—the heart\nof the pattern—which describes the field of physical and\nsocial relationships which are required to solve the stated\nproblem, in the stated context. This solution is always\nexactly what you need to do, to build the pattern. Then,\nafter the solution, there is a diagram, which shows the\nsolution in the form of a diagram, with labels to indicate\nits main components.\nAfter the diagram, another three diamonds, to show\nthat the main body of the pattern is finished. And finally,\nafter the diamonds there is a paragraph which ties the\npattern to all those smaller patterns in the language,\nwhich are needed to complete this pattern, to embellish\nit, to All it out.\nThere are two essential purposes behind this format.\nFirst, to present each pattern connected to other patterns,\nso that you grasp the collection of all 253 patterns as a\nwhole, as a language, within which you can create an in-\nfinite variety of combinations. Second, to present the\nproblem and solution of each pattern in such a way that\nyou can judge it for yourself, and modify it, without\nlosing the essence that is central to it.\nLet us next understand the nature of the connection\nbetween patterns.\nXI\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nThe patterns are ordered, beginning with the very\nlargest, for regions and towns, then working down\nthrough neighborhoods, clusters of buildings, buildings,\nrooms and alcoves, ending finally with details of con-\nstruction.\nThis order, which is presented as a straight linear\nsequerice, is essential to the way the language works. It is\npresented, and explained more fully, in the next section.\nWhat is most important about this sequence, is that it is\nbased on the connections between the patterns. Each\npattern is connected to certain “larger” patterns which\ncome above it in the language; and to certain “smaller”\npatterns which come below it in the language. The pat-\ntern helps to complete those larger patterns which are\n“above” it, and is itself completed by those smaller pat-\nterns which are “below” it.\nThus, for example, you will find that the pattern ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN (60), is connected first to certain larger\npatterns: SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY (13), IDENTIFIABLE\nNEIGHBORHOOD (14), WORK COMMUNITY (41), and\nquirr Backs (59). These appear on its first page. And it\nis also connected to certain smaller patterns: PosiTIVE\nOUTDOOR SPACE (107), TREE PLACES (171), and GARDEN\nWALL (173). These appear on its last page.\nWhat this means, is that IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBOR-\nHOOD, SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, WORK COMMUNITY, and\nQUIET BACKS are incomplete, unless they contain an ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN; and that an ACCESSIBLE GREEN is itself\nincomplete, unless it contains POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nAnd what it means in practical terms is that, if you\nx\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to lay out a green according to this pattern, you\nmust not only follow the instructions which describe the\npattern itself, but must also try to embed the green\nWithin an IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD or in some sUB-\nCULTURE BOUNDARY, and in a way that helps to form\nquizr Backs; and then you must work to complete the\ngreen by building in some posiTIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nIn short, no pattern is an isolated entity. Each pattern\ncan exist in the world, only to the extent that is sup-\nported by other patterns: the larger patterns in which it\nis embedded, the patterns of the same size that surround\nit, and the smaller patterns which are embedded in it.\nThis is a fundamental view of the world, It says that\nwhen you build a thing you cannot merely build that\nthing in isolation, but must also repair the world around\nit, and within it, so that the larger world at that one\nplace becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the\nthing which you make takes its place in the web of na-\nture, as you make it.\nNow we explain the nature of the relation between\nproblems and solutions, within the individual patterns.\nEach solution is stated in such a way that it gives the\nessential field of relationships needed to solve the prob-\nlem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you\ncan solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by\nadapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions\nat the place where you are making it.\nFor this reason, we have tried to write each solution\nin a way which imposes nothing on you. It contains only\nthose essentials which cannot be avoided if you really\nXU\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to solve the problem. In this sense, we have tried,\nin each solution, to capture the invariant property com-\nmon to all places which succeed in solving the problem.\nBut of course, we have not always succeeded. The\nsolutions we have given to these problems vary in signif-\ncance, Some are more true, more profound, more cer-\ntain, than others. To show this clearly we have marked\nevery pattern, in the text itself, with two asterisks, or one\nasterisk, or no asterisks.\nIn the patterns marked with two asterisks, we believe\nthat we have succeeded in stating a true invariant: in\nshort, that the solution we have stated summarizes a\nproperty common to all possible ways of solving the\nstated problem. In these two-asterisk cases we believe,\nin short, that it is not possible to solve the stated prob-\nlem properly, without shaping the environment in one\nway or another according to the pattern that we have\ngiven—and that, in these cases, the pattern describes\na deep and inescapable property of a well-formed en-\nvironment.\nIn the patterns marked with one asterisk, we believe\nthat we have made some progress towards identifying\nsuch an invariant: but that with careful work it will\ncertainly be possible to improve on the solution, In\nthese cases, we believe it would be wise for you to treat\nthe pattern with a certain amount of disrespect—and\nthat you seek out variants of the solution which we have\ngiven, since there are almost certainly possible ranges of\nsolutions which are not covered by what we have written.\nFinally, in the patterns without an asterisk, we are\ncertain that we have mot succeeded in defining a true\nx1V\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\ninvariant—that, on the contrary, there are certainly ways\nof solving the problem different from the one which we\nhave given. In these cases we have still stated a solution,\nin order to be concrete—to provide the reader with at\nleast one way of solving the problem-—but the task of\nfinding the true invariant, the true property which hes\nat the heart of all possible solutions to this problem, re-\nmains undone.\nWe hope, of course, that many of the people who\nread, and use this language, will try to improve these\npatterns—will put their energy to work, in this task of\nfinding more true, more profound invariants—and we\nhope that gradually these more true patterns, which are\nslowly discovered, as time goes on, will enter a common\nlanguage, which all of us can share.\nYou see then that the patterns are very much alive\nand evolving. In fact, if you like, each pattern may be\nlooked upon as a hypothesis like one of the hypotheses of\nscience. In this sense, each pattern represents our current\nbest guess as to what arrangement of the physical envi-\nronment will work to solve the problem presented. The\nempirical questions center on the problem—does it occur\nand is it felt in the way we have described it?—-and the\nsolution—-does the arrangement we propose in fact re-\nsolve the problem? And the asterisks represent our\ndegree of faith in these hypotheses. But of course, no\nmatter what the asterisks say, the patterns are still\nhypotheses, all 253 of them-—-and are therefore all\ntentative, all free to evolve under the impact of new\nexperience and observation.\nLet us finally explain the status of this language, why\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwe have called it “A Pattern Language” with the em-\nphasis on the word “A,” and how we imagine this pat-\ntern language might be related to the countless thou-\nsands of other languages we hope that people will make\nfor themselves, in the future.\nThe Timeless Way of Building says that every society\nwhich is alive and whole, will have its own unique and\ndistinct pattern language; and further, that every in-\ndividual in such a society will have a unique language,\nshared in part, but which as a totality is unique to the\nraind of the person who has it. In this sense, in a healthy\nsociety there will be as many pattern languages as there\nare people—even though these languages are shared and\nsimular,\nThe question then arises: What exactly is the status\nof this published language? In what frame of mind, and\nwith what intention, are we publishing this language\nhere? The fact that it is published as a book means that\nmany thousands of people can use it. Is it not true that\nthere is a danger that people might come to rely on this\none printed language, instead of developing their own\nlanguages, in their own minds?\nThe fact is, that we have written this book as a first\nstep in the society-wide process by which people will\ngradually become conscious of their own pattern lan-\nguages, and work to improve them. We believe, and\nhave explained in The Timeless Way of Building, that\nthe languages which people have today are so brutal, and\nso fragmented, that most people no longer have any\nlanguage to speak of at all—and what they do have is\nnot based on human, or natural considerations.\nXVI\n& PATTERN LANGUAGE\nWe have spent years trying to formulate this lan-\nguage, in the hope that when a person uses tt, he will\nbe so impressed by its power, and so joyful in its use,\nthat he will understand again, what it means to have a\nliving language of this kind. [If we only succeed in that,\nit is possible that each person may once again embark on\nthe construction and development of his own language—\nperhaps taking the language printed in this book, as a\npoint of departure.\nAnd yet, we do believe, of course, that this language\nwhich is printed here is something more than a manual,\nor a teacher, or a version of a possible pattern language.\nMany of the patterns here are archetypal—so deep, so\ndeeply rooted in the nature of things, that it seems likely\nthat they will be a part of human nature, and human ac-\ntion, as much in five hundred years, as they are today.\nWe doubt very much whether anyone could construct\na valid pattern language, in his own mind, which did\nnot include the pattern arcapes (119) for example, or\nthe pattern aLcoves (179).\nIn this sense, we have also tried to penetrate, as deep\nas we are able, into the nature of things in the environ-\nment: and hope that a great part of this language, which\nwe print here, will be a core of any sensible human pat-\ntern language, which any person constructs for himself,\nin his own mind. In this sense, at least a part of the\nlanguage we have presented here, is the archetypal core\nof all possible pattern languages, which can make people\nfeel alive and human.\nXVII\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nA pattern language has the structure of a network. This\nis explained fully in The Timeless Way of Bualdimg.\nHowever, when we use the network of a language, we\nalways use it as a sequence, going through the patterns,\nmoving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,\nalways from the ones which create structures, to the ones\nwhich then embellish those structures, and then to those\nwhich embellish the embellishments. . . .\nSince the language is in truth a network, there is no\none sequence which perfectly captures it. But the se-\nquence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the\nfull network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down,\ndips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little\nlike a needle following a tapestry.\nThe sequence of patterns is both a summary of the\nlanguage, and at the same time, an index to the patterns.\nIf you read through the sentences which connect the\ngroups of patterns to one another, you will get an over-\nview of the whole language. And once you get this over-\nview, you will then be able to find the patterns which\nare relevant to your own project.\nAnd finally, as we shall explain in the next section,\nthis sequence of patterns is also the “base map,” from\nKVL\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nwhich you can make a language for your own project,\nby choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,\nand leaving them more or less in the order that you\nfind them printed here.\nWe begin with that part of the language which defines\na town or community. These patterns can never be “de-\nsigned” or “buil?” in one fell swoop—but patient piece-\nmeal growth, designed in such a way that every indi-\nvidual act is always helping to create or generate these\nlarger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the\nyears, make a community that has these global patterns\nin tk.\nI.

They create\na coherent picture of an entire region, with the power\nto generate such regions in a million forms, with in-\nfinite variety in all the details.\nIt 1s also true that any small sequence of patterns from\nthis language is itself a language for a smaller part of\nthe environment; and this small list of patterns is then\ncapable of generating a million parks, paths, houses,\nworkshops, or gardens.\nFor example, consider the following ten patterns:\nPRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET (140)\nSUNNY PLACE (161)\nOUTDOOR ROOM (163)\nSIX-FOOT BALCONY (167)\nPATHS AND GOALS (120)\nCEILING HEIGHT VARIETY (190)\nCOLUMNS AT THE CORNERS (212)\nFRONT DOOR BENCH (242)\nRAISED FLOWERS (245)\nDIFFERENT CHAIRS (251)\nThis short list of patterns is itself a language: it is one\nof a thousand possible languages for a porch, at the front\nof a house, One of us chose this small language, to build\nAXERV\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBYJECT\na porch onto the front of his house. This is the way the\nlanguage, and its patterns, helped to generate this porch.\nI started with PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE sTREET (140). That\npattern calls for a terrace, slightly raised, connected to the house,\nand on the street side. suNNY PLACE (161) suggests that a special\nplace on the sunny side of the yard should be intensified and\nmade into a place by the use of a patio, balcony, outdoor room,\netc, | used these two patterns to locate a raised platform on the\nsouth side of the house.\nit half under the existing roof overhang, and kept a mature\npyracanthus tree right smack in the middle of the platform. The\noverhead foliage of the tree added to the roof-like enclosure of\nthe space. I put a wind screen of fixed glass on the west side of\nthe platform too, to give it even more enclosure.\nplatform. But this pattern had to be used judiciously and not\nblindly—the reasoning for the pattern has to do with the mini-\nmum space required for people to sit comfortably and carry on a\ndiscussion around a small side-table. Since 1 wanted space for at\nleast two of these conversation areas—one under the roof for very\nfeet square.\nNow PATHS AND Goats (120): Usually, this pattern deals with\nlarge paths in a neighborhood, and comes much earlier in a lan-\nguage. But I used it in a special way. It says that the paths which\nnaturally get formed by people’s walking, on the land, should be\npreserved and intensified. Since the path to our front door cut\nright across the corner of the place where 1 had planned to put\nthe platform, 1 cut the corner of the platform aff.\nThe height of the platform above the ground was determined\nby CEILING HEIGHT varieETY (190). By building the platform\napproximately one foot above the ground line, the ceiling height\nof the covered portion came out at between 6 and 7 feet——just\nright for a space as small as this. Since this height above the\nBOOR BENCH (242) was automatically satisfied.\nThere were three columns standing, supporting the roof over\nXXXVI]ground level is just about right for sitting, the pattern FRONT\nhot or rainy days, and one out under the sky for days when you\nwanted to be full in the sun, the balcony had to be made 12 x 12\nI used six-Foor BaLcony (167) to determine the size of the\nTo make this platform into an ovTsoor Room (163), I put\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nthe old porch, They had to stay where they are, because they hold\nthe roof up. But, following covumns ar THE coRNERs (212),\nthe platform was very carefully tailored to their positions—so that\nthe columns help define the social spaces on either side of them.\nFinally, we put a couple of flower boxes next to the “front door\nbench”—it’s nice to smell them when you sit there—according to\nRAISED FLowERs (245). And the old chairs you can see in the\nporch are DIeFERENT CHAIRS (251).\nYou can see, from this short example, how powerful\nand simple a pattern language is, And you are now,\nperhaps ready to appreciate how careful you must be,\nwhen you construct a language for yourself and your\nown project.\nThe character of the porch is given by the ten patterns\nin this short language. In just this way, each part of the\nenvironment is given its character by the collection of\npatterns which we choose to build into it. The character\nof what you build, will be given to it by the language of\npatterns you use, to generate it.\nXxxvii\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nFor this reason, of course, the task of choosing a lan-\nguage for your project is fundamental. The pattern lan-\nguage we have given here contains 253 patterns. You\ncan therefore use it to generate an almost unimaginably\nlarge number of possible different smaller languages,\nfor all the different projects you may choose to do,\nsimply by picking patterns from it.\nWe shall now describe a rough procedure by which\nyou can choose a language for your own project, first by\ntaking patterns from this language we have printed here,\nand then by adding patterns of your own.\nr. First of all, make a copy of the master sequence\n(pages xix-xxxiv) on which you can tick off the patterns\nwhich will form the language for your project. If you\ndon’t have access to a copying machine, you can tick off\npatterns in the list printed in the book, use paper clips\nto mark pages, write your own list, use paper markers—\nwhatever you like. But just for now, to explain it clearly,\nwe shall assume that you have a copy of the list in front\nof you.\n2. Scan down the list, and find the pattern which\nbest describes the overall scope of the project you have\nin mind, This is the starting pattern for your project.\nTick it. CIE there are two or three possible candidates,\ndon’t worry: just pick the one which seems best: the\nothers will fall in place as you move forward.)\n3. Turn to the starting pattern itself, in the book, and\nread it through. Notice that the other patterns men-\ntioned by name at the beginning and at the end, of the\npattern you are reading, are also possible candidates for\nyour language. The ones at the beginning will tend to be\n“larger” than your project. Don’t include them, unless\nXXXVI\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nyou have the power to help create these patterns, at least\nin a small way, in the world around your project. The\nones at the end are “smaller.” Almost all of them will\nbe important. Tick all of them, on your list, unless you\nhave some special reason for not wanting to include\nthem.\n4. Now your list has some more ticks on it. Turn to\nthe next highest pattern on the list which is ticked, and\nopen the book to that pattern. Once again, it will lead\nyou to other patterns. Once again, tick those which are\nrelevant—especially the ones which are “smaller” that\ncome at the end. As a general rule, do not tick the ones\nwhich are “larger” unless you can do something about\nthem, concretely, in your own project.\n5. When in doubt about a pattern, don’t include it.\nYour list can easily get too long: and if it does, it will\nbecome confusing. The list will be quite long enough,\neven if you only include the patterns you especially like.\n6. Keep going like this, until you have ticked all the\npatterns you want for your project.\n7. Now, adjust the sequence by adding your own ma-\nterial. If there are things you want to include in your\nproject, but you have not been able to find patterns which\ncorrespond to them, then write them in, at an appropri-\nate point in the sequence, near other patterns which are\nof about the same size and importance. For example,\nthere is no pattern for a sauna. If you want to include\none, write it in somewhere near BATHING ROOM (144)\nin your sequence.\n8. And of course, if you want to change any patterns,\nchange them. There are often cases where you may have\na personal version of a pattern, which is more true, or\nXXXIN\nCHOCSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nmore relevant for you. In this case, you will get the most\n“power” over the language, and make it your own most\neffectively, if you write the changes in, at the appropri-\nate places in the book. And, it will be most concrete of\nall, if you change the name of the pattern too—so that\nit captures your own changes clearly.\nyp oe\nSuppose now that you have a language for your proj-\nect. The way to use the language depends very much\non its scale. Patterns dealing with towns can only be\nimplemented gradually, by grass roots action; patterns\nfor a building can be built up in your mind, and marked\nout on the ground; patterns for construction must be\nbuilt physically, on the site. For this reason we have\ngiven three separate instructions, for these three different\nscales. For towns, see page 3; for buildings, see page\n463; for construction, see page 935.\nThe procedures for each of these three scales are de-\nscribed in much more detail with extensive examples,\nin the appropriate chapters of The Timeless Way of\nBuilding. For the town—see chapters 24 and 25; for an\nindividual building—see chapters 20, 21, and 22; and for\nthe process of construction which describes the way a\nbuilding is actually built see chapter 23.\nxh\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nFinally, a note of caution. This language, lke English,\ncan be a medium for prose, or a medium for poetry. The\ndifference between prose and poetry is not that different\nJanpuages are used, but that the same language is used,\ndifferently. In an ordinary English sentence, each word\nhas one meaning, and the sentence too, has one simple\nmeaning. In a poem, the meaning is far more dense.\nEach word carries several meanings; and the sentence\nas a Whole carries an enormous density of interlocking\nmeanings, which together illuminate the whole.\nThe same is true for pattern languages. It is possible\nto make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a\nrather loose way. A building made like this, is an as-\nsembly of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound.\nBut it 1s also possible to put patterns together in such a\nway that many many patterns overlap in the same\nphysical space: the building is very dense; it has many\nmeanings captured in a small space; and through this\ndensity, it becomes profound.\nIn a poern, this kind of density, creates illumination,\nby making identities between words, and meanings,\nwhose identity we have not understood before. In “O\nRose thou art sick,” the rose is identifed with many\nxii\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\ngreater, and more personal things than any rose—and\nthe poem illuminates the person, and the rose, because of\nthis connection. The connection not only illuminates the\nwords, but also illuminates our actual lives.\n© Rose thon art sick,\n‘The invisible worm,\nThat flies in the night\nin the howling storm:\nHas found out thy bed\nOF crimson joy:\nAnd his dark secret Jove\nDoes thy life destroy,\nWILLIAM BLAKE\nThe same exactly, happens in a building, Consider, for\nexample, the two patterns BATHING ROOM (144) and\nSTILL WATER (71). One defines a part of a house where\nyou can bathe yourself slowly, with pleasure, perhaps\nin company; a place to rest your limbs, and to relax. The\nother is a place in a neighborhood, where this is water\nto gaze into, perhaps to swim in, where children can sail\nboats, and splash about, which nourishes those parts of\nourselves which rely on water as one of the great\nelements of the unconscious.\nSuppose now, that we make a complex of buildings\nwhere individual bathing rooms are somehow connected\nto a common pond, or lake, or pool—where the bathing\nroom merges with this common place; where there is no\nsharp distinction between the individual and family pro-\ncesses of the bathing room, and the common pleasure\nof the common pool. In this place, these two patterns\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nexist in the same space; they are identified, there is a\ncompression of the two, which requires less space, and\nwhich is more profound than in a place where they are\nmerely side by side. The compression illuminates each\nof the patterns, sheds light on its meaning; and also i-\nluminates our lives, as we understand a little more about\nthe connections of our inner needs.\nBut this kind of compression is not only poetic and\nprofound. It is not only the stuff of poems and exotic\nstatements, but to some degree, the stuff of every English\nsentence. To some depree, there is compression in every\nsingle word we utter, just because each word carries the\nwhisper of the meanings of the words it is connected to.\nEven “Please pass the butter, Fred” has some compres-\nsion in it, because it carries overtones that lie in the con-\nnections of these words to all the words which came be-\nfore it.\nFach of us, talking to our friends, or to our families,\nmakes use of these compressions, which are drawn out\nfrom the connections between words which are given by\nthe language. The more we can feel all the connections\nin the language, the more rich and subtle are the things\nwe say at the most ordinary times.\nAnd once again, the same is true in building. The com-\npression of patterns into a single space, is not a poetic\nand exotic thing, kept for special buildings which are\nworks of art. It is the most ordinary economy of space. It\nis quite possible that all the patterns for a house might,\nin some form be present, and overlapping, in a simple\none-room cabin, The patterns do not need to be strung\nout, and kept separate. Every building, every room,\nxd\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nevery garden is better, when all the patterns which it\nneeds are compressed as far as it is possible for them to\nbe. The building will be cheaper; and the meanings in it\nwill be denser.\nIt is essential then, once you have learned to use the\nlanguage, that you pay attention to the possibility of\ncompressing the many patterns which you put together,\nin the smallest possible space. You may think of this\nprocess of compressing patterns, as a way to make the\ncheapest possible building which has the necessary pat-\nterns in it. It is, also, the only way of using a pattern\nlanguage to make buildings which are poems.\n","summary":"This chunk is part of a larger pattern language for designing towns, neighborhoods, buildings, and construction details.

Among the special natural places covered by SACRED SITES (24), we single out the ocean beaches, lakes, and river banks, because they are irreplaceable. Their maintenance and proper use require a special pattern.\n\nPeople have a fundamental yearning for great bodies of water. But the very movement of the people toward the water can also destroy the water.\n\nEither roads, freeways, and industries destroy the water's edge and make it so dirty or so treacherous that it is virtually inaccessible; or when the water's edge is preserved, it falls into private hands.\n\n![79_image_0.png](79_image_0.png)\n\nAccess to water is blocked.\nBut the need that people have for water is vital and profound.\n\n(See, for example, C. G. Jung, Symbols of Transformation, where Jung takes bodies of water which appear in dreams as a consistent representation of the dreamer's unconscious.)\nThe problem can be solved only if it is understood that people will build places near the water because it is entirely natural; but that the land immediately along the water's edge must be preserved for common use. To this end the roads which can destroy the water's edge must be kept back from it and only allowed near it when they lie at right angles to it,\n\n![80_image_0.png](80_image_0.png)\n\nLife forms around the water's edge.\nThe width of the belt of land along the water may vary with the type of water, the density of development along it, and the ecological conditions. Along high density development, it may be no more than a simple stone promenade. Along low density development, it may be a common parkland extending hundreds of yards beyond a beach.\n\nTherefore:\nWhen natural bodies of water occur near human settlements, treat them with great respect. Always preserve a belt of common land, immediately beside the water. And allow dense settlements to come right down to the water only at infrequent intervals along the water's edge.\n\n![80_image_1.png](80_image_1.png)\n\nThe width of the common land will vary with the type of water and the ecological conditions. In one case, it may be no more than a simple stone promenade along a river bank a few feet wide-PROMENADE (31). In another case, it may be a swath of dunes extending hundreds of yards beyond a beach-THE COUN-\nTRYSIDE (7).

This book. describes the\ndetailed patterns for towns and neighborhoods, houses,\ngardens, and rooms. The other book explains the disci-\npline which makes it possible to use these patterns to\ncreate a building or a town. This book is the sourcebook of\nthe timeless way; the other is its practice and its origin.\nThe two books have evolved very much in parallel.\nThey have been growing over the last eight years, as\nwe have worked on the one hand to understand the\nnature of the building process, and on the other hand to\nconstruct an actual, possible pattern language. We have\nbeen forced by practical considerations, to publish these\ntwo books under separate covers; but in fact, they form\nan indivisible whole. It is possible to read them sepa-\nrately. But to gain the insight which we have tried to\ncommunicate in them, it is essential that you read them\nboth.\nThe Timeless Way of Building describes the funda-\nmental nature of the task of making towns and buildings.\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nIt is shown there, that towns and buildings will not be\nable to become alive, unless they are made by all the\npeople in society, and unless these people share a com-\nmon pattern language, within which to make these\nbuildings, and unless this cornmon pattern language is\nalive itself.\nTn this book, we present one possible pattern language,\nof the kind called for in The Timeless Way. This lan-\nguage is extremely practical. It is a language that we\nhave distilled from our own building and planning ef-\nforts over the last eight years. You can use it to work\nwith your neighbors, to improve your town and neighbor-\nhood. You can use it to design a house for yourself,\nwith your family; or to work with other people to de-\nsign an office or a workshop or a public building like a\nschool. And you can use it to guide you in the actual\nprocess of construction.\nThe elements of this language are entities called pat-\nterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs\nover and over again in our environment, and then\ndescribes the core of the solution to that problem, in such\na way that you can use this solution a million times over,\nwithout ever doing it the same way twice.\nFor convenience and clarity, each pattern has the same\nformat. First, there is a picture, which shows an arche-\ntypal example of that pattern. Second, after the picture,\neach pattern has an introductory paragraph, which sets\nthe context for the pattern, by explaining how it helps\nto complete certain larger patterns. Then there are three\ndiamonds to mark the beginning of the problem. After\nthe diamonds there is a headline, in bold type. This\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nheadline gives the essence of the problem in one or two\nsentences. After the headline comes the body of the\nproblem. This is the longest section. It describes the\nempirical background of the pattern, the evidence for its\nvalidity, the range of different ways the pattern can be\nmanifested in a building, and so on. Then, again in\nbold type, like the headline, is the solution—the heart\nof the pattern—which describes the field of physical and\nsocial relationships which are required to solve the stated\nproblem, in the stated context. This solution is always\nexactly what you need to do, to build the pattern. Then,\nafter the solution, there is a diagram, which shows the\nsolution in the form of a diagram, with labels to indicate\nits main components.\nAfter the diagram, another three diamonds, to show\nthat the main body of the pattern is finished. And finally,\nafter the diamonds there is a paragraph which ties the\npattern to all those smaller patterns in the language,\nwhich are needed to complete this pattern, to embellish\nit, to All it out.\nThere are two essential purposes behind this format.\nFirst, to present each pattern connected to other patterns,\nso that you grasp the collection of all 253 patterns as a\nwhole, as a language, within which you can create an in-\nfinite variety of combinations. Second, to present the\nproblem and solution of each pattern in such a way that\nyou can judge it for yourself, and modify it, without\nlosing the essence that is central to it.\nLet us next understand the nature of the connection\nbetween patterns.\nXI\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nThe patterns are ordered, beginning with the very\nlargest, for regions and towns, then working down\nthrough neighborhoods, clusters of buildings, buildings,\nrooms and alcoves, ending finally with details of con-\nstruction.\nThis order, which is presented as a straight linear\nsequerice, is essential to the way the language works. It is\npresented, and explained more fully, in the next section.\nWhat is most important about this sequence, is that it is\nbased on the connections between the patterns. Each\npattern is connected to certain “larger” patterns which\ncome above it in the language; and to certain “smaller”\npatterns which come below it in the language. The pat-\ntern helps to complete those larger patterns which are\n“above” it, and is itself completed by those smaller pat-\nterns which are “below” it.\nThus, for example, you will find that the pattern ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN (60), is connected first to certain larger\npatterns: SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY (13), IDENTIFIABLE\nNEIGHBORHOOD (14), WORK COMMUNITY (41), and\nquirr Backs (59). These appear on its first page. And it\nis also connected to certain smaller patterns: PosiTIVE\nOUTDOOR SPACE (107), TREE PLACES (171), and GARDEN\nWALL (173). These appear on its last page.\nWhat this means, is that IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBOR-\nHOOD, SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, WORK COMMUNITY, and\nQUIET BACKS are incomplete, unless they contain an ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN; and that an ACCESSIBLE GREEN is itself\nincomplete, unless it contains POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nAnd what it means in practical terms is that, if you\nx\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to lay out a green according to this pattern, you\nmust not only follow the instructions which describe the\npattern itself, but must also try to embed the green\nWithin an IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD or in some sUB-\nCULTURE BOUNDARY, and in a way that helps to form\nquizr Backs; and then you must work to complete the\ngreen by building in some posiTIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nIn short, no pattern is an isolated entity. Each pattern\ncan exist in the world, only to the extent that is sup-\nported by other patterns: the larger patterns in which it\nis embedded, the patterns of the same size that surround\nit, and the smaller patterns which are embedded in it.\nThis is a fundamental view of the world, It says that\nwhen you build a thing you cannot merely build that\nthing in isolation, but must also repair the world around\nit, and within it, so that the larger world at that one\nplace becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the\nthing which you make takes its place in the web of na-\nture, as you make it.\nNow we explain the nature of the relation between\nproblems and solutions, within the individual patterns.\nEach solution is stated in such a way that it gives the\nessential field of relationships needed to solve the prob-\nlem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you\ncan solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by\nadapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions\nat the place where you are making it.\nFor this reason, we have tried to write each solution\nin a way which imposes nothing on you. It contains only\nthose essentials which cannot be avoided if you really\nXU\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to solve the problem. In this sense, we have tried,\nin each solution, to capture the invariant property com-\nmon to all places which succeed in solving the problem.\nBut of course, we have not always succeeded. The\nsolutions we have given to these problems vary in signif-\ncance, Some are more true, more profound, more cer-\ntain, than others. To show this clearly we have marked\nevery pattern, in the text itself, with two asterisks, or one\nasterisk, or no asterisks.\nIn the patterns marked with two asterisks, we believe\nthat we have succeeded in stating a true invariant: in\nshort, that the solution we have stated summarizes a\nproperty common to all possible ways of solving the\nstated problem. In these two-asterisk cases we believe,\nin short, that it is not possible to solve the stated prob-\nlem properly, without shaping the environment in one\nway or another according to the pattern that we have\ngiven—and that, in these cases, the pattern describes\na deep and inescapable property of a well-formed en-\nvironment.\nIn the patterns marked with one asterisk, we believe\nthat we have made some progress towards identifying\nsuch an invariant: but that with careful work it will\ncertainly be possible to improve on the solution, In\nthese cases, we believe it would be wise for you to treat\nthe pattern with a certain amount of disrespect—and\nthat you seek out variants of the solution which we have\ngiven, since there are almost certainly possible ranges of\nsolutions which are not covered by what we have written.\nFinally, in the patterns without an asterisk, we are\ncertain that we have mot succeeded in defining a true\nx1V\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\ninvariant—that, on the contrary, there are certainly ways\nof solving the problem different from the one which we\nhave given. In these cases we have still stated a solution,\nin order to be concrete—to provide the reader with at\nleast one way of solving the problem-—but the task of\nfinding the true invariant, the true property which hes\nat the heart of all possible solutions to this problem, re-\nmains undone.\nWe hope, of course, that many of the people who\nread, and use this language, will try to improve these\npatterns—will put their energy to work, in this task of\nfinding more true, more profound invariants—and we\nhope that gradually these more true patterns, which are\nslowly discovered, as time goes on, will enter a common\nlanguage, which all of us can share.\nYou see then that the patterns are very much alive\nand evolving. In fact, if you like, each pattern may be\nlooked upon as a hypothesis like one of the hypotheses of\nscience. In this sense, each pattern represents our current\nbest guess as to what arrangement of the physical envi-\nronment will work to solve the problem presented. The\nempirical questions center on the problem—does it occur\nand is it felt in the way we have described it?—-and the\nsolution—-does the arrangement we propose in fact re-\nsolve the problem? And the asterisks represent our\ndegree of faith in these hypotheses. But of course, no\nmatter what the asterisks say, the patterns are still\nhypotheses, all 253 of them-—-and are therefore all\ntentative, all free to evolve under the impact of new\nexperience and observation.\nLet us finally explain the status of this language, why\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwe have called it “A Pattern Language” with the em-\nphasis on the word “A,” and how we imagine this pat-\ntern language might be related to the countless thou-\nsands of other languages we hope that people will make\nfor themselves, in the future.\nThe Timeless Way of Building says that every society\nwhich is alive and whole, will have its own unique and\ndistinct pattern language; and further, that every in-\ndividual in such a society will have a unique language,\nshared in part, but which as a totality is unique to the\nraind of the person who has it. In this sense, in a healthy\nsociety there will be as many pattern languages as there\nare people—even though these languages are shared and\nsimular,\nThe question then arises: What exactly is the status\nof this published language? In what frame of mind, and\nwith what intention, are we publishing this language\nhere? The fact that it is published as a book means that\nmany thousands of people can use it. Is it not true that\nthere is a danger that people might come to rely on this\none printed language, instead of developing their own\nlanguages, in their own minds?\nThe fact is, that we have written this book as a first\nstep in the society-wide process by which people will\ngradually become conscious of their own pattern lan-\nguages, and work to improve them. We believe, and\nhave explained in The Timeless Way of Building, that\nthe languages which people have today are so brutal, and\nso fragmented, that most people no longer have any\nlanguage to speak of at all—and what they do have is\nnot based on human, or natural considerations.\nXVI\n& PATTERN LANGUAGE\nWe have spent years trying to formulate this lan-\nguage, in the hope that when a person uses tt, he will\nbe so impressed by its power, and so joyful in its use,\nthat he will understand again, what it means to have a\nliving language of this kind. [If we only succeed in that,\nit is possible that each person may once again embark on\nthe construction and development of his own language—\nperhaps taking the language printed in this book, as a\npoint of departure.\nAnd yet, we do believe, of course, that this language\nwhich is printed here is something more than a manual,\nor a teacher, or a version of a possible pattern language.\nMany of the patterns here are archetypal—so deep, so\ndeeply rooted in the nature of things, that it seems likely\nthat they will be a part of human nature, and human ac-\ntion, as much in five hundred years, as they are today.\nWe doubt very much whether anyone could construct\na valid pattern language, in his own mind, which did\nnot include the pattern arcapes (119) for example, or\nthe pattern aLcoves (179).\nIn this sense, we have also tried to penetrate, as deep\nas we are able, into the nature of things in the environ-\nment: and hope that a great part of this language, which\nwe print here, will be a core of any sensible human pat-\ntern language, which any person constructs for himself,\nin his own mind. In this sense, at least a part of the\nlanguage we have presented here, is the archetypal core\nof all possible pattern languages, which can make people\nfeel alive and human.\nXVII\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nA pattern language has the structure of a network. This\nis explained fully in The Timeless Way of Bualdimg.\nHowever, when we use the network of a language, we\nalways use it as a sequence, going through the patterns,\nmoving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,\nalways from the ones which create structures, to the ones\nwhich then embellish those structures, and then to those\nwhich embellish the embellishments. . . .\nSince the language is in truth a network, there is no\none sequence which perfectly captures it. But the se-\nquence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the\nfull network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down,\ndips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little\nlike a needle following a tapestry.\nThe sequence of patterns is both a summary of the\nlanguage, and at the same time, an index to the patterns.\nIf you read through the sentences which connect the\ngroups of patterns to one another, you will get an over-\nview of the whole language. And once you get this over-\nview, you will then be able to find the patterns which\nare relevant to your own project.\nAnd finally, as we shall explain in the next section,\nthis sequence of patterns is also the “base map,” from\nKVL\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nwhich you can make a language for your own project,\nby choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,\nand leaving them more or less in the order that you\nfind them printed here.\nWe begin with that part of the language which defines\na town or community. These patterns can never be “de-\nsigned” or “buil?” in one fell swoop—but patient piece-\nmeal growth, designed in such a way that every indi-\nvidual act is always helping to create or generate these\nlarger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the\nyears, make a community that has these global patterns\nin tk.\nI.

They create\na coherent picture of an entire region, with the power\nto generate such regions in a million forms, with in-\nfinite variety in all the details.\nIt 1s also true that any small sequence of patterns from\nthis language is itself a language for a smaller part of\nthe environment; and this small list of patterns is then\ncapable of generating a million parks, paths, houses,\nworkshops, or gardens.\nFor example, consider the following ten patterns:\nPRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET (140)\nSUNNY PLACE (161)\nOUTDOOR ROOM (163)\nSIX-FOOT BALCONY (167)\nPATHS AND GOALS (120)\nCEILING HEIGHT VARIETY (190)\nCOLUMNS AT THE CORNERS (212)\nFRONT DOOR BENCH (242)\nRAISED FLOWERS (245)\nDIFFERENT CHAIRS (251)\nThis short list of patterns is itself a language: it is one\nof a thousand possible languages for a porch, at the front\nof a house, One of us chose this small language, to build\nAXERV\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBYJECT\na porch onto the front of his house. This is the way the\nlanguage, and its patterns, helped to generate this porch.\nI started with PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE sTREET (140). That\npattern calls for a terrace, slightly raised, connected to the house,\nand on the street side. suNNY PLACE (161) suggests that a special\nplace on the sunny side of the yard should be intensified and\nmade into a place by the use of a patio, balcony, outdoor room,\netc, | used these two patterns to locate a raised platform on the\nsouth side of the house.\nit half under the existing roof overhang, and kept a mature\npyracanthus tree right smack in the middle of the platform. The\noverhead foliage of the tree added to the roof-like enclosure of\nthe space. I put a wind screen of fixed glass on the west side of\nthe platform too, to give it even more enclosure.\nplatform. But this pattern had to be used judiciously and not\nblindly—the reasoning for the pattern has to do with the mini-\nmum space required for people to sit comfortably and carry on a\ndiscussion around a small side-table. Since 1 wanted space for at\nleast two of these conversation areas—one under the roof for very\nfeet square.\nNow PATHS AND Goats (120): Usually, this pattern deals with\nlarge paths in a neighborhood, and comes much earlier in a lan-\nguage. But I used it in a special way. It says that the paths which\nnaturally get formed by people’s walking, on the land, should be\npreserved and intensified. Since the path to our front door cut\nright across the corner of the place where 1 had planned to put\nthe platform, 1 cut the corner of the platform aff.\nThe height of the platform above the ground was determined\nby CEILING HEIGHT varieETY (190). By building the platform\napproximately one foot above the ground line, the ceiling height\nof the covered portion came out at between 6 and 7 feet——just\nright for a space as small as this. Since this height above the\nBOOR BENCH (242) was automatically satisfied.\nThere were three columns standing, supporting the roof over\nXXXVI]ground level is just about right for sitting, the pattern FRONT\nhot or rainy days, and one out under the sky for days when you\nwanted to be full in the sun, the balcony had to be made 12 x 12\nI used six-Foor BaLcony (167) to determine the size of the\nTo make this platform into an ovTsoor Room (163), I put\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nthe old porch, They had to stay where they are, because they hold\nthe roof up. But, following covumns ar THE coRNERs (212),\nthe platform was very carefully tailored to their positions—so that\nthe columns help define the social spaces on either side of them.\nFinally, we put a couple of flower boxes next to the “front door\nbench”—it’s nice to smell them when you sit there—according to\nRAISED FLowERs (245). And the old chairs you can see in the\nporch are DIeFERENT CHAIRS (251).\nYou can see, from this short example, how powerful\nand simple a pattern language is, And you are now,\nperhaps ready to appreciate how careful you must be,\nwhen you construct a language for yourself and your\nown project.\nThe character of the porch is given by the ten patterns\nin this short language. In just this way, each part of the\nenvironment is given its character by the collection of\npatterns which we choose to build into it. The character\nof what you build, will be given to it by the language of\npatterns you use, to generate it.\nXxxvii\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nFor this reason, of course, the task of choosing a lan-\nguage for your project is fundamental. The pattern lan-\nguage we have given here contains 253 patterns. You\ncan therefore use it to generate an almost unimaginably\nlarge number of possible different smaller languages,\nfor all the different projects you may choose to do,\nsimply by picking patterns from it.\nWe shall now describe a rough procedure by which\nyou can choose a language for your own project, first by\ntaking patterns from this language we have printed here,\nand then by adding patterns of your own.\nr. First of all, make a copy of the master sequence\n(pages xix-xxxiv) on which you can tick off the patterns\nwhich will form the language for your project. If you\ndon’t have access to a copying machine, you can tick off\npatterns in the list printed in the book, use paper clips\nto mark pages, write your own list, use paper markers—\nwhatever you like. But just for now, to explain it clearly,\nwe shall assume that you have a copy of the list in front\nof you.\n2. Scan down the list, and find the pattern which\nbest describes the overall scope of the project you have\nin mind, This is the starting pattern for your project.\nTick it. CIE there are two or three possible candidates,\ndon’t worry: just pick the one which seems best: the\nothers will fall in place as you move forward.)\n3. Turn to the starting pattern itself, in the book, and\nread it through. Notice that the other patterns men-\ntioned by name at the beginning and at the end, of the\npattern you are reading, are also possible candidates for\nyour language. The ones at the beginning will tend to be\n“larger” than your project. Don’t include them, unless\nXXXVI\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nyou have the power to help create these patterns, at least\nin a small way, in the world around your project. The\nones at the end are “smaller.” Almost all of them will\nbe important. Tick all of them, on your list, unless you\nhave some special reason for not wanting to include\nthem.\n4. Now your list has some more ticks on it. Turn to\nthe next highest pattern on the list which is ticked, and\nopen the book to that pattern. Once again, it will lead\nyou to other patterns. Once again, tick those which are\nrelevant—especially the ones which are “smaller” that\ncome at the end. As a general rule, do not tick the ones\nwhich are “larger” unless you can do something about\nthem, concretely, in your own project.\n5. When in doubt about a pattern, don’t include it.\nYour list can easily get too long: and if it does, it will\nbecome confusing. The list will be quite long enough,\neven if you only include the patterns you especially like.\n6. Keep going like this, until you have ticked all the\npatterns you want for your project.\n7. Now, adjust the sequence by adding your own ma-\nterial. If there are things you want to include in your\nproject, but you have not been able to find patterns which\ncorrespond to them, then write them in, at an appropri-\nate point in the sequence, near other patterns which are\nof about the same size and importance. For example,\nthere is no pattern for a sauna. If you want to include\none, write it in somewhere near BATHING ROOM (144)\nin your sequence.\n8. And of course, if you want to change any patterns,\nchange them. There are often cases where you may have\na personal version of a pattern, which is more true, or\nXXXIN\nCHOCSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nmore relevant for you. In this case, you will get the most\n“power” over the language, and make it your own most\neffectively, if you write the changes in, at the appropri-\nate places in the book. And, it will be most concrete of\nall, if you change the name of the pattern too—so that\nit captures your own changes clearly.\nyp oe\nSuppose now that you have a language for your proj-\nect. The way to use the language depends very much\non its scale. Patterns dealing with towns can only be\nimplemented gradually, by grass roots action; patterns\nfor a building can be built up in your mind, and marked\nout on the ground; patterns for construction must be\nbuilt physically, on the site. For this reason we have\ngiven three separate instructions, for these three different\nscales. For towns, see page 3; for buildings, see page\n463; for construction, see page 935.\nThe procedures for each of these three scales are de-\nscribed in much more detail with extensive examples,\nin the appropriate chapters of The Timeless Way of\nBuilding. For the town—see chapters 24 and 25; for an\nindividual building—see chapters 20, 21, and 22; and for\nthe process of construction which describes the way a\nbuilding is actually built see chapter 23.\nxh\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nFinally, a note of caution. This language, lke English,\ncan be a medium for prose, or a medium for poetry. The\ndifference between prose and poetry is not that different\nJanpuages are used, but that the same language is used,\ndifferently. In an ordinary English sentence, each word\nhas one meaning, and the sentence too, has one simple\nmeaning. In a poem, the meaning is far more dense.\nEach word carries several meanings; and the sentence\nas a Whole carries an enormous density of interlocking\nmeanings, which together illuminate the whole.\nThe same is true for pattern languages. It is possible\nto make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a\nrather loose way. A building made like this, is an as-\nsembly of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound.\nBut it 1s also possible to put patterns together in such a\nway that many many patterns overlap in the same\nphysical space: the building is very dense; it has many\nmeanings captured in a small space; and through this\ndensity, it becomes profound.\nIn a poern, this kind of density, creates illumination,\nby making identities between words, and meanings,\nwhose identity we have not understood before. In “O\nRose thou art sick,” the rose is identifed with many\nxii\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\ngreater, and more personal things than any rose—and\nthe poem illuminates the person, and the rose, because of\nthis connection. The connection not only illuminates the\nwords, but also illuminates our actual lives.\n© Rose thon art sick,\n‘The invisible worm,\nThat flies in the night\nin the howling storm:\nHas found out thy bed\nOF crimson joy:\nAnd his dark secret Jove\nDoes thy life destroy,\nWILLIAM BLAKE\nThe same exactly, happens in a building, Consider, for\nexample, the two patterns BATHING ROOM (144) and\nSTILL WATER (71). One defines a part of a house where\nyou can bathe yourself slowly, with pleasure, perhaps\nin company; a place to rest your limbs, and to relax. The\nother is a place in a neighborhood, where this is water\nto gaze into, perhaps to swim in, where children can sail\nboats, and splash about, which nourishes those parts of\nourselves which rely on water as one of the great\nelements of the unconscious.\nSuppose now, that we make a complex of buildings\nwhere individual bathing rooms are somehow connected\nto a common pond, or lake, or pool—where the bathing\nroom merges with this common place; where there is no\nsharp distinction between the individual and family pro-\ncesses of the bathing room, and the common pleasure\nof the common pool. In this place, these two patterns\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nexist in the same space; they are identified, there is a\ncompression of the two, which requires less space, and\nwhich is more profound than in a place where they are\nmerely side by side. The compression illuminates each\nof the patterns, sheds light on its meaning; and also i-\nluminates our lives, as we understand a little more about\nthe connections of our inner needs.\nBut this kind of compression is not only poetic and\nprofound. It is not only the stuff of poems and exotic\nstatements, but to some degree, the stuff of every English\nsentence. To some depree, there is compression in every\nsingle word we utter, just because each word carries the\nwhisper of the meanings of the words it is connected to.\nEven “Please pass the butter, Fred” has some compres-\nsion in it, because it carries overtones that lie in the con-\nnections of these words to all the words which came be-\nfore it.\nFach of us, talking to our friends, or to our families,\nmakes use of these compressions, which are drawn out\nfrom the connections between words which are given by\nthe language. The more we can feel all the connections\nin the language, the more rich and subtle are the things\nwe say at the most ordinary times.\nAnd once again, the same is true in building. The com-\npression of patterns into a single space, is not a poetic\nand exotic thing, kept for special buildings which are\nworks of art. It is the most ordinary economy of space. It\nis quite possible that all the patterns for a house might,\nin some form be present, and overlapping, in a simple\none-room cabin, The patterns do not need to be strung\nout, and kept separate. Every building, every room,\nxd\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nevery garden is better, when all the patterns which it\nneeds are compressed as far as it is possible for them to\nbe. The building will be cheaper; and the meanings in it\nwill be denser.\nIt is essential then, once you have learned to use the\nlanguage, that you pay attention to the possibility of\ncompressing the many patterns which you put together,\nin the smallest possible space. You may think of this\nprocess of compressing patterns, as a way to make the\ncheapest possible building which has the necessary pat-\nterns in it. It is, also, the only way of using a pattern\nlanguage to make buildings which are poems.\n","summary":"This chunk discusses the pattern \"Identifiable Neighborhood\" as part of the larger pattern language for designing towns and communities described in the book \"A Pattern Language\".","chunk":"# 14    Identifiable Neighborhood**\n\n![23_Image_0.Png](23_Image_0.Png)\n\n. . . the Mosaic of subcultures (8) and the community op 7000 (12) are made up of neighborhoods. This pattern defines the neighborhoods. It defines those small human groups which create the energy and character which can bring the larger com- MUNITY OF 7000 (12) and the MOSAIC OF SUBCULTURES (8) to life.\n\nPeople need an identifiable spatial unit to belong to.\n\n![24_image_0.png](24_image_0.png)\n\nToday's pattern of dovelopment destroys neighborhoods.\nThey want to be able to identify the part of the city where they live as distinct from all others. Available evidence suggests, first, that the neighborhoods which people identify with have extremely small populations; second, that they are small in area; and third, that a major road through a neighborhood destroys it.\n\nI. What is the right population for a neighborhood?\n\nThe neighborhood inhabitants should be able to look after their own interests by organizing themselves to bring pressure on city hall or local governments. This means the families in a neighborhood must be able to reach agreement on basic decisions about public services, community land, and so forth. Anthropological evidence suggests that a human group cannot coordinate itself to reach such decisions if its population is above 1500, and many people set the figure as low as 500. (See, for example, Anthony Wallace, Housing and Social Structure, Philadelphia Housing Au-\n\n## 8 I\n\n![25_image_0.png](25_image_0.png)\n\nA famous neighborhood: the Fuggerei in Augsburg.\nthority, 1952, available from University Microfilms, Inc., Ann Arbor, Michigan, pp. 21-24.) The experience of organizing community meetings at the local level suggests that 500 is the more realistic figure.\n\n2. As far as the physical diameter is concerned, in Philadelphia, people who were asked which area they really knew usually limited themselves to a small area, seldom exceeding the two to three blocks around their own house. (Mary W. Herman, \"Comparative Studies of Identification Areas in Philadelphia,\" City of Philadelphia Community Renewal Program, Technical Report No. 9, April 1964.) One-quarter of the inhabitants of an area in Milwaukee considered a neighborhood to be an area no larger than.\n\na block (300 feet). One-half considered it to be no more than seven blocks. (Svend Riemer, \"Villagers in Metropolis,\" British Journal of Sociology, 2, No. 1, March 1951, pp. 31-43.)\n3. The first two features, by themselves, are not enough. A\nneighborhood can only have a strong identity if it is protected from heavy traffic. Donald Appleyard and Mark Lintell have tfound that the heavier the traffic in an area, the less people think of it as home territory. Not only do residents view the streets with heavy traffic as less personal, but they feel the same about\n\nthe houses along the street. (\"Environmental Quality of City Streets,\" by Donald Appleyard and Mark Lintell, Center for Planning and Development Research, University of California, Berkeley, 1971.)\nneighborhood with light traffic 2000 vehicles/day 200 vehicles/peak hour 15-20 mph Two-way Residents speaking on \"neighboring and visiting\" I feel it's home. There are warm people on this street.

I feel my home extends to the whole block.\n\nneighborhood with moderate traffic 6000 vehicles/day 550 vehicles/peak hour 25 mph Two-way Residents speaking on \"neighboring and visiting\" You see the neighbors but they aren't close friends.

People are afraid to go into the street because of the traffic.\n\nResidents speaking on \"home territory\" It is impersonal and public.\n\nNoise from the street intrudes into my home.\n\nHow shall we define a major road? The Appleyard-Lintell study found that with more than 200 cars per hour, the quality of the neighborhood begins to deteriorate. On the streets with 550 cars per hour people visit their neighbors less and never gather in the street to meet and talk. Research by Colin Buchanan indicates that major roads become a barrier to free pedestrian movement when \"most people (more than 50%) . . . have to adapt their movement to give way to vehicles.\" This is based on \"an average delay to all crossing pedestrians of 2 seconds . . . as a very rough guide to the borderline between acceptable and unacceptable conditions,\" which happens when the traffic reaches some 150 to 250 cars per hour. (Colin D. Buchanan, Traffic in Towns, London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1963, p. 204.) Thus any street with greater than 200 cars per hour, at any time, will probably seem \"major,\" and start to destroy the neighborhood identity.\n\nA final note on implementation, Several months ago the City of Berkeley began a transportation survey with the idea of deciding the location of all future major arteries within the city. Citizens were asked to make statements about areas which they wanted to protect from heavy traffic. This simple request has caused widespread grass roots political organizing to take place: at the time of this writing more than 30 small neighborhoods have identified themselves, simply in order to make sure that they succeed in keeping heavy traffic out. In short, the issue of traffic is so fundamental to the fact of neighborhoods, that neighborhoods emerge, and crystallize, as soon as people are asked to decide where they want nearby traffic to be. Perhaps this is a universal way of implementing this pattern in existing cities.\n\nTherefore:\nHelp people to define the neighborhoods they live in, not more than 300 yards across, with no more than 400 or 500 inhabitants. In existing cities, encourage local groups to organize themselves to form such neighborhoods. Give the neighborhoods some degree of autonomy as far as taxes and land controls are concerned. Keep major roads outside these neighborhoods.\n\n![28_image_0.png](28_image_0.png)\n\nmax. population of 500 max diameter of 300 yards\nMark the neighborhood, above all, by gateways wherever main.\n\npaths enter it-MAIN GATEWAYs (53)-and by modest boundaries.\n\nof non-residential land between the neighborhoods-NEIGHBOR-\nHOOD BOUNDARY (15).

This book. describes the\ndetailed patterns for towns and neighborhoods, houses,\ngardens, and rooms. The other book explains the disci-\npline which makes it possible to use these patterns to\ncreate a building or a town. This book is the sourcebook of\nthe timeless way; the other is its practice and its origin.\nThe two books have evolved very much in parallel.\nThey have been growing over the last eight years, as\nwe have worked on the one hand to understand the\nnature of the building process, and on the other hand to\nconstruct an actual, possible pattern language. We have\nbeen forced by practical considerations, to publish these\ntwo books under separate covers; but in fact, they form\nan indivisible whole. It is possible to read them sepa-\nrately. But to gain the insight which we have tried to\ncommunicate in them, it is essential that you read them\nboth.\nThe Timeless Way of Building describes the funda-\nmental nature of the task of making towns and buildings.\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nIt is shown there, that towns and buildings will not be\nable to become alive, unless they are made by all the\npeople in society, and unless these people share a com-\nmon pattern language, within which to make these\nbuildings, and unless this cornmon pattern language is\nalive itself.\nTn this book, we present one possible pattern language,\nof the kind called for in The Timeless Way. This lan-\nguage is extremely practical. It is a language that we\nhave distilled from our own building and planning ef-\nforts over the last eight years. You can use it to work\nwith your neighbors, to improve your town and neighbor-\nhood. You can use it to design a house for yourself,\nwith your family; or to work with other people to de-\nsign an office or a workshop or a public building like a\nschool. And you can use it to guide you in the actual\nprocess of construction.\nThe elements of this language are entities called pat-\nterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs\nover and over again in our environment, and then\ndescribes the core of the solution to that problem, in such\na way that you can use this solution a million times over,\nwithout ever doing it the same way twice.\nFor convenience and clarity, each pattern has the same\nformat. First, there is a picture, which shows an arche-\ntypal example of that pattern. Second, after the picture,\neach pattern has an introductory paragraph, which sets\nthe context for the pattern, by explaining how it helps\nto complete certain larger patterns. Then there are three\ndiamonds to mark the beginning of the problem. After\nthe diamonds there is a headline, in bold type. This\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nheadline gives the essence of the problem in one or two\nsentences. After the headline comes the body of the\nproblem. This is the longest section. It describes the\nempirical background of the pattern, the evidence for its\nvalidity, the range of different ways the pattern can be\nmanifested in a building, and so on. Then, again in\nbold type, like the headline, is the solution—the heart\nof the pattern—which describes the field of physical and\nsocial relationships which are required to solve the stated\nproblem, in the stated context. This solution is always\nexactly what you need to do, to build the pattern. Then,\nafter the solution, there is a diagram, which shows the\nsolution in the form of a diagram, with labels to indicate\nits main components.\nAfter the diagram, another three diamonds, to show\nthat the main body of the pattern is finished. And finally,\nafter the diamonds there is a paragraph which ties the\npattern to all those smaller patterns in the language,\nwhich are needed to complete this pattern, to embellish\nit, to All it out.\nThere are two essential purposes behind this format.\nFirst, to present each pattern connected to other patterns,\nso that you grasp the collection of all 253 patterns as a\nwhole, as a language, within which you can create an in-\nfinite variety of combinations. Second, to present the\nproblem and solution of each pattern in such a way that\nyou can judge it for yourself, and modify it, without\nlosing the essence that is central to it.\nLet us next understand the nature of the connection\nbetween patterns.\nXI\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nThe patterns are ordered, beginning with the very\nlargest, for regions and towns, then working down\nthrough neighborhoods, clusters of buildings, buildings,\nrooms and alcoves, ending finally with details of con-\nstruction.\nThis order, which is presented as a straight linear\nsequerice, is essential to the way the language works. It is\npresented, and explained more fully, in the next section.\nWhat is most important about this sequence, is that it is\nbased on the connections between the patterns. Each\npattern is connected to certain “larger” patterns which\ncome above it in the language; and to certain “smaller”\npatterns which come below it in the language. The pat-\ntern helps to complete those larger patterns which are\n“above” it, and is itself completed by those smaller pat-\nterns which are “below” it.\nThus, for example, you will find that the pattern ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN (60), is connected first to certain larger\npatterns: SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY (13), IDENTIFIABLE\nNEIGHBORHOOD (14), WORK COMMUNITY (41), and\nquirr Backs (59). These appear on its first page. And it\nis also connected to certain smaller patterns: PosiTIVE\nOUTDOOR SPACE (107), TREE PLACES (171), and GARDEN\nWALL (173). These appear on its last page.\nWhat this means, is that IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBOR-\nHOOD, SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, WORK COMMUNITY, and\nQUIET BACKS are incomplete, unless they contain an ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN; and that an ACCESSIBLE GREEN is itself\nincomplete, unless it contains POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nAnd what it means in practical terms is that, if you\nx\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to lay out a green according to this pattern, you\nmust not only follow the instructions which describe the\npattern itself, but must also try to embed the green\nWithin an IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD or in some sUB-\nCULTURE BOUNDARY, and in a way that helps to form\nquizr Backs; and then you must work to complete the\ngreen by building in some posiTIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nIn short, no pattern is an isolated entity. Each pattern\ncan exist in the world, only to the extent that is sup-\nported by other patterns: the larger patterns in which it\nis embedded, the patterns of the same size that surround\nit, and the smaller patterns which are embedded in it.\nThis is a fundamental view of the world, It says that\nwhen you build a thing you cannot merely build that\nthing in isolation, but must also repair the world around\nit, and within it, so that the larger world at that one\nplace becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the\nthing which you make takes its place in the web of na-\nture, as you make it.\nNow we explain the nature of the relation between\nproblems and solutions, within the individual patterns.\nEach solution is stated in such a way that it gives the\nessential field of relationships needed to solve the prob-\nlem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you\ncan solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by\nadapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions\nat the place where you are making it.\nFor this reason, we have tried to write each solution\nin a way which imposes nothing on you. It contains only\nthose essentials which cannot be avoided if you really\nXU\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to solve the problem. In this sense, we have tried,\nin each solution, to capture the invariant property com-\nmon to all places which succeed in solving the problem.\nBut of course, we have not always succeeded. The\nsolutions we have given to these problems vary in signif-\ncance, Some are more true, more profound, more cer-\ntain, than others. To show this clearly we have marked\nevery pattern, in the text itself, with two asterisks, or one\nasterisk, or no asterisks.\nIn the patterns marked with two asterisks, we believe\nthat we have succeeded in stating a true invariant: in\nshort, that the solution we have stated summarizes a\nproperty common to all possible ways of solving the\nstated problem. In these two-asterisk cases we believe,\nin short, that it is not possible to solve the stated prob-\nlem properly, without shaping the environment in one\nway or another according to the pattern that we have\ngiven—and that, in these cases, the pattern describes\na deep and inescapable property of a well-formed en-\nvironment.\nIn the patterns marked with one asterisk, we believe\nthat we have made some progress towards identifying\nsuch an invariant: but that with careful work it will\ncertainly be possible to improve on the solution, In\nthese cases, we believe it would be wise for you to treat\nthe pattern with a certain amount of disrespect—and\nthat you seek out variants of the solution which we have\ngiven, since there are almost certainly possible ranges of\nsolutions which are not covered by what we have written.\nFinally, in the patterns without an asterisk, we are\ncertain that we have mot succeeded in defining a true\nx1V\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\ninvariant—that, on the contrary, there are certainly ways\nof solving the problem different from the one which we\nhave given. In these cases we have still stated a solution,\nin order to be concrete—to provide the reader with at\nleast one way of solving the problem-—but the task of\nfinding the true invariant, the true property which hes\nat the heart of all possible solutions to this problem, re-\nmains undone.\nWe hope, of course, that many of the people who\nread, and use this language, will try to improve these\npatterns—will put their energy to work, in this task of\nfinding more true, more profound invariants—and we\nhope that gradually these more true patterns, which are\nslowly discovered, as time goes on, will enter a common\nlanguage, which all of us can share.\nYou see then that the patterns are very much alive\nand evolving. In fact, if you like, each pattern may be\nlooked upon as a hypothesis like one of the hypotheses of\nscience. In this sense, each pattern represents our current\nbest guess as to what arrangement of the physical envi-\nronment will work to solve the problem presented. The\nempirical questions center on the problem—does it occur\nand is it felt in the way we have described it?—-and the\nsolution—-does the arrangement we propose in fact re-\nsolve the problem? And the asterisks represent our\ndegree of faith in these hypotheses. But of course, no\nmatter what the asterisks say, the patterns are still\nhypotheses, all 253 of them-—-and are therefore all\ntentative, all free to evolve under the impact of new\nexperience and observation.\nLet us finally explain the status of this language, why\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwe have called it “A Pattern Language” with the em-\nphasis on the word “A,” and how we imagine this pat-\ntern language might be related to the countless thou-\nsands of other languages we hope that people will make\nfor themselves, in the future.\nThe Timeless Way of Building says that every society\nwhich is alive and whole, will have its own unique and\ndistinct pattern language; and further, that every in-\ndividual in such a society will have a unique language,\nshared in part, but which as a totality is unique to the\nraind of the person who has it. In this sense, in a healthy\nsociety there will be as many pattern languages as there\nare people—even though these languages are shared and\nsimular,\nThe question then arises: What exactly is the status\nof this published language? In what frame of mind, and\nwith what intention, are we publishing this language\nhere? The fact that it is published as a book means that\nmany thousands of people can use it. Is it not true that\nthere is a danger that people might come to rely on this\none printed language, instead of developing their own\nlanguages, in their own minds?\nThe fact is, that we have written this book as a first\nstep in the society-wide process by which people will\ngradually become conscious of their own pattern lan-\nguages, and work to improve them. We believe, and\nhave explained in The Timeless Way of Building, that\nthe languages which people have today are so brutal, and\nso fragmented, that most people no longer have any\nlanguage to speak of at all—and what they do have is\nnot based on human, or natural considerations.\nXVI\n& PATTERN LANGUAGE\nWe have spent years trying to formulate this lan-\nguage, in the hope that when a person uses tt, he will\nbe so impressed by its power, and so joyful in its use,\nthat he will understand again, what it means to have a\nliving language of this kind. [If we only succeed in that,\nit is possible that each person may once again embark on\nthe construction and development of his own language—\nperhaps taking the language printed in this book, as a\npoint of departure.\nAnd yet, we do believe, of course, that this language\nwhich is printed here is something more than a manual,\nor a teacher, or a version of a possible pattern language.\nMany of the patterns here are archetypal—so deep, so\ndeeply rooted in the nature of things, that it seems likely\nthat they will be a part of human nature, and human ac-\ntion, as much in five hundred years, as they are today.\nWe doubt very much whether anyone could construct\na valid pattern language, in his own mind, which did\nnot include the pattern arcapes (119) for example, or\nthe pattern aLcoves (179).\nIn this sense, we have also tried to penetrate, as deep\nas we are able, into the nature of things in the environ-\nment: and hope that a great part of this language, which\nwe print here, will be a core of any sensible human pat-\ntern language, which any person constructs for himself,\nin his own mind. In this sense, at least a part of the\nlanguage we have presented here, is the archetypal core\nof all possible pattern languages, which can make people\nfeel alive and human.\nXVII\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nA pattern language has the structure of a network. This\nis explained fully in The Timeless Way of Bualdimg.\nHowever, when we use the network of a language, we\nalways use it as a sequence, going through the patterns,\nmoving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,\nalways from the ones which create structures, to the ones\nwhich then embellish those structures, and then to those\nwhich embellish the embellishments. . . .\nSince the language is in truth a network, there is no\none sequence which perfectly captures it. But the se-\nquence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the\nfull network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down,\ndips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little\nlike a needle following a tapestry.\nThe sequence of patterns is both a summary of the\nlanguage, and at the same time, an index to the patterns.\nIf you read through the sentences which connect the\ngroups of patterns to one another, you will get an over-\nview of the whole language. And once you get this over-\nview, you will then be able to find the patterns which\nare relevant to your own project.\nAnd finally, as we shall explain in the next section,\nthis sequence of patterns is also the “base map,” from\nKVL\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nwhich you can make a language for your own project,\nby choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,\nand leaving them more or less in the order that you\nfind them printed here.\nWe begin with that part of the language which defines\na town or community. These patterns can never be “de-\nsigned” or “buil?” in one fell swoop—but patient piece-\nmeal growth, designed in such a way that every indi-\nvidual act is always helping to create or generate these\nlarger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the\nyears, make a community that has these global patterns\nin tk.\nI.

They create\na coherent picture of an entire region, with the power\nto generate such regions in a million forms, with in-\nfinite variety in all the details.\nIt 1s also true that any small sequence of patterns from\nthis language is itself a language for a smaller part of\nthe environment; and this small list of patterns is then\ncapable of generating a million parks, paths, houses,\nworkshops, or gardens.\nFor example, consider the following ten patterns:\nPRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET (140)\nSUNNY PLACE (161)\nOUTDOOR ROOM (163)\nSIX-FOOT BALCONY (167)\nPATHS AND GOALS (120)\nCEILING HEIGHT VARIETY (190)\nCOLUMNS AT THE CORNERS (212)\nFRONT DOOR BENCH (242)\nRAISED FLOWERS (245)\nDIFFERENT CHAIRS (251)\nThis short list of patterns is itself a language: it is one\nof a thousand possible languages for a porch, at the front\nof a house, One of us chose this small language, to build\nAXERV\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBYJECT\na porch onto the front of his house. This is the way the\nlanguage, and its patterns, helped to generate this porch.\nI started with PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE sTREET (140). That\npattern calls for a terrace, slightly raised, connected to the house,\nand on the street side. suNNY PLACE (161) suggests that a special\nplace on the sunny side of the yard should be intensified and\nmade into a place by the use of a patio, balcony, outdoor room,\netc, | used these two patterns to locate a raised platform on the\nsouth side of the house.\nit half under the existing roof overhang, and kept a mature\npyracanthus tree right smack in the middle of the platform. The\noverhead foliage of the tree added to the roof-like enclosure of\nthe space. I put a wind screen of fixed glass on the west side of\nthe platform too, to give it even more enclosure.\nplatform. But this pattern had to be used judiciously and not\nblindly—the reasoning for the pattern has to do with the mini-\nmum space required for people to sit comfortably and carry on a\ndiscussion around a small side-table. Since 1 wanted space for at\nleast two of these conversation areas—one under the roof for very\nfeet square.\nNow PATHS AND Goats (120): Usually, this pattern deals with\nlarge paths in a neighborhood, and comes much earlier in a lan-\nguage. But I used it in a special way. It says that the paths which\nnaturally get formed by people’s walking, on the land, should be\npreserved and intensified. Since the path to our front door cut\nright across the corner of the place where 1 had planned to put\nthe platform, 1 cut the corner of the platform aff.\nThe height of the platform above the ground was determined\nby CEILING HEIGHT varieETY (190). By building the platform\napproximately one foot above the ground line, the ceiling height\nof the covered portion came out at between 6 and 7 feet——just\nright for a space as small as this. Since this height above the\nBOOR BENCH (242) was automatically satisfied.\nThere were three columns standing, supporting the roof over\nXXXVI]ground level is just about right for sitting, the pattern FRONT\nhot or rainy days, and one out under the sky for days when you\nwanted to be full in the sun, the balcony had to be made 12 x 12\nI used six-Foor BaLcony (167) to determine the size of the\nTo make this platform into an ovTsoor Room (163), I put\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nthe old porch, They had to stay where they are, because they hold\nthe roof up. But, following covumns ar THE coRNERs (212),\nthe platform was very carefully tailored to their positions—so that\nthe columns help define the social spaces on either side of them.\nFinally, we put a couple of flower boxes next to the “front door\nbench”—it’s nice to smell them when you sit there—according to\nRAISED FLowERs (245). And the old chairs you can see in the\nporch are DIeFERENT CHAIRS (251).\nYou can see, from this short example, how powerful\nand simple a pattern language is, And you are now,\nperhaps ready to appreciate how careful you must be,\nwhen you construct a language for yourself and your\nown project.\nThe character of the porch is given by the ten patterns\nin this short language. In just this way, each part of the\nenvironment is given its character by the collection of\npatterns which we choose to build into it. The character\nof what you build, will be given to it by the language of\npatterns you use, to generate it.\nXxxvii\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nFor this reason, of course, the task of choosing a lan-\nguage for your project is fundamental. The pattern lan-\nguage we have given here contains 253 patterns. You\ncan therefore use it to generate an almost unimaginably\nlarge number of possible different smaller languages,\nfor all the different projects you may choose to do,\nsimply by picking patterns from it.\nWe shall now describe a rough procedure by which\nyou can choose a language for your own project, first by\ntaking patterns from this language we have printed here,\nand then by adding patterns of your own.\nr. First of all, make a copy of the master sequence\n(pages xix-xxxiv) on which you can tick off the patterns\nwhich will form the language for your project. If you\ndon’t have access to a copying machine, you can tick off\npatterns in the list printed in the book, use paper clips\nto mark pages, write your own list, use paper markers—\nwhatever you like. But just for now, to explain it clearly,\nwe shall assume that you have a copy of the list in front\nof you.\n2. Scan down the list, and find the pattern which\nbest describes the overall scope of the project you have\nin mind, This is the starting pattern for your project.\nTick it. CIE there are two or three possible candidates,\ndon’t worry: just pick the one which seems best: the\nothers will fall in place as you move forward.)\n3. Turn to the starting pattern itself, in the book, and\nread it through. Notice that the other patterns men-\ntioned by name at the beginning and at the end, of the\npattern you are reading, are also possible candidates for\nyour language. The ones at the beginning will tend to be\n“larger” than your project. Don’t include them, unless\nXXXVI\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nyou have the power to help create these patterns, at least\nin a small way, in the world around your project. The\nones at the end are “smaller.” Almost all of them will\nbe important. Tick all of them, on your list, unless you\nhave some special reason for not wanting to include\nthem.\n4. Now your list has some more ticks on it. Turn to\nthe next highest pattern on the list which is ticked, and\nopen the book to that pattern. Once again, it will lead\nyou to other patterns. Once again, tick those which are\nrelevant—especially the ones which are “smaller” that\ncome at the end. As a general rule, do not tick the ones\nwhich are “larger” unless you can do something about\nthem, concretely, in your own project.\n5. When in doubt about a pattern, don’t include it.\nYour list can easily get too long: and if it does, it will\nbecome confusing. The list will be quite long enough,\neven if you only include the patterns you especially like.\n6. Keep going like this, until you have ticked all the\npatterns you want for your project.\n7. Now, adjust the sequence by adding your own ma-\nterial. If there are things you want to include in your\nproject, but you have not been able to find patterns which\ncorrespond to them, then write them in, at an appropri-\nate point in the sequence, near other patterns which are\nof about the same size and importance. For example,\nthere is no pattern for a sauna. If you want to include\none, write it in somewhere near BATHING ROOM (144)\nin your sequence.\n8. And of course, if you want to change any patterns,\nchange them. There are often cases where you may have\na personal version of a pattern, which is more true, or\nXXXIN\nCHOCSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nmore relevant for you. In this case, you will get the most\n“power” over the language, and make it your own most\neffectively, if you write the changes in, at the appropri-\nate places in the book. And, it will be most concrete of\nall, if you change the name of the pattern too—so that\nit captures your own changes clearly.\nyp oe\nSuppose now that you have a language for your proj-\nect. The way to use the language depends very much\non its scale. Patterns dealing with towns can only be\nimplemented gradually, by grass roots action; patterns\nfor a building can be built up in your mind, and marked\nout on the ground; patterns for construction must be\nbuilt physically, on the site. For this reason we have\ngiven three separate instructions, for these three different\nscales. For towns, see page 3; for buildings, see page\n463; for construction, see page 935.\nThe procedures for each of these three scales are de-\nscribed in much more detail with extensive examples,\nin the appropriate chapters of The Timeless Way of\nBuilding. For the town—see chapters 24 and 25; for an\nindividual building—see chapters 20, 21, and 22; and for\nthe process of construction which describes the way a\nbuilding is actually built see chapter 23.\nxh\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nFinally, a note of caution. This language, lke English,\ncan be a medium for prose, or a medium for poetry. The\ndifference between prose and poetry is not that different\nJanpuages are used, but that the same language is used,\ndifferently. In an ordinary English sentence, each word\nhas one meaning, and the sentence too, has one simple\nmeaning. In a poem, the meaning is far more dense.\nEach word carries several meanings; and the sentence\nas a Whole carries an enormous density of interlocking\nmeanings, which together illuminate the whole.\nThe same is true for pattern languages. It is possible\nto make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a\nrather loose way. A building made like this, is an as-\nsembly of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound.\nBut it 1s also possible to put patterns together in such a\nway that many many patterns overlap in the same\nphysical space: the building is very dense; it has many\nmeanings captured in a small space; and through this\ndensity, it becomes profound.\nIn a poern, this kind of density, creates illumination,\nby making identities between words, and meanings,\nwhose identity we have not understood before. In “O\nRose thou art sick,” the rose is identifed with many\nxii\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\ngreater, and more personal things than any rose—and\nthe poem illuminates the person, and the rose, because of\nthis connection. The connection not only illuminates the\nwords, but also illuminates our actual lives.\n© Rose thon art sick,\n‘The invisible worm,\nThat flies in the night\nin the howling storm:\nHas found out thy bed\nOF crimson joy:\nAnd his dark secret Jove\nDoes thy life destroy,\nWILLIAM BLAKE\nThe same exactly, happens in a building, Consider, for\nexample, the two patterns BATHING ROOM (144) and\nSTILL WATER (71). One defines a part of a house where\nyou can bathe yourself slowly, with pleasure, perhaps\nin company; a place to rest your limbs, and to relax. The\nother is a place in a neighborhood, where this is water\nto gaze into, perhaps to swim in, where children can sail\nboats, and splash about, which nourishes those parts of\nourselves which rely on water as one of the great\nelements of the unconscious.\nSuppose now, that we make a complex of buildings\nwhere individual bathing rooms are somehow connected\nto a common pond, or lake, or pool—where the bathing\nroom merges with this common place; where there is no\nsharp distinction between the individual and family pro-\ncesses of the bathing room, and the common pleasure\nof the common pool. In this place, these two patterns\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nexist in the same space; they are identified, there is a\ncompression of the two, which requires less space, and\nwhich is more profound than in a place where they are\nmerely side by side. The compression illuminates each\nof the patterns, sheds light on its meaning; and also i-\nluminates our lives, as we understand a little more about\nthe connections of our inner needs.\nBut this kind of compression is not only poetic and\nprofound. It is not only the stuff of poems and exotic\nstatements, but to some degree, the stuff of every English\nsentence. To some depree, there is compression in every\nsingle word we utter, just because each word carries the\nwhisper of the meanings of the words it is connected to.\nEven “Please pass the butter, Fred” has some compres-\nsion in it, because it carries overtones that lie in the con-\nnections of these words to all the words which came be-\nfore it.\nFach of us, talking to our friends, or to our families,\nmakes use of these compressions, which are drawn out\nfrom the connections between words which are given by\nthe language. The more we can feel all the connections\nin the language, the more rich and subtle are the things\nwe say at the most ordinary times.\nAnd once again, the same is true in building. The com-\npression of patterns into a single space, is not a poetic\nand exotic thing, kept for special buildings which are\nworks of art. It is the most ordinary economy of space. It\nis quite possible that all the patterns for a house might,\nin some form be present, and overlapping, in a simple\none-room cabin, The patterns do not need to be strung\nout, and kept separate. Every building, every room,\nxd\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nevery garden is better, when all the patterns which it\nneeds are compressed as far as it is possible for them to\nbe. The building will be cheaper; and the meanings in it\nwill be denser.\nIt is essential then, once you have learned to use the\nlanguage, that you pay attention to the possibility of\ncompressing the many patterns which you put together,\nin the smallest possible space. You may think of this\nprocess of compressing patterns, as a way to make the\ncheapest possible building which has the necessary pat-\nterns in it. It is, also, the only way of using a pattern\nlanguage to make buildings which are poems.\n","summary":"This chunk discusses the pattern of \"Subculture Boundary\" within the larger context of the book \"A Pattern Language\", which presents a comprehensive language for designing and building towns, neighborhoods, buildings, and construction details. The pattern emphasizes the need to physically separate neighboring subcultures with natural or artificial boundaries to allow each subculture to develop its own distinct character.","chunk":"# 13 Subculture Boundary*\n\n![18_image_0.png](18_image_0.png)\n\n. . . the MOSAIC OF SUBCULTURES (8) and its individual subcultures, whether they are communities of 7000 (12) or IDEN- TIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOODS (14), need to be completed by boundaries. In fact, the mere creation of the boundary areas, according to this pattern, will begin to give life to the subcultures between the boundaries, by giving them a chance to be themselves.\n\nThe mosaic of subcultures requires that hundreds of different cultures live, in their own way, at full intensity, next door to one another. But subcultures have their own ecology. They can only live at full intensity, unhampered by their neighbors, if they are physically separated by physical boundaries.\n\nIn MOSAIC OF SUBCULTURES (8) we have argued that a great variety of subcultures in a city is not a racist pattern which forms ghettos, but a pattern of opportunity which allows a city to contain a multitude of different ways of life with the greatest possible intensity.\n\nBut this mosaic will only come into being if the various subcultures are insulated from one another, at least enough so that no one of them can oppress, or subdue, the life style of its neighbors, nor, in return, feel oppressed or subdued. As we shall see, this requires that adjacent subcultures are scparated by swaths of open land, workplaces, public buildings, water, parks, or other natural boundaries.\n\nThe argument hinges on the following fact. Wherever there is an area of homogeneous housing in a city, its inhabitants will exert strong pressure on the areas adjacent to it to make them conform to their values and style. For example, the \"straight\" people who lived near the \"hippie\" Haight Ashbury district in San Francisco in 1967 were afraid that the Haight would send their land values down, so they put pressure on City Hall to get the Haight \"cleaned up\"-that is, to make the Haight more like their own area. This seems to happen whenever one subculture is\n\nvery different in style from another one next to it. People will be afraid that the neighboring area is going to \"encroach\" on their own area, upset their land values, undermine their children, send the \"nice\" people away, and so forth, and they will do everything they can to make the next door area like their own.\n\nCarl Werthman, Jerry Mandel, and Ted Dienstfrey (Planning and the Purchase Decision: Why People Buy in Planned Communities, University of California, Berkeley, July 1965) have noticed the same phenomenon even among very similar subcultures. In a study of people living in tract developments, they found that the tension created by adjacencies between dissimilar social groups disappeared when there was enough open land, unused land, freeway, or water between them. In short, a physical barrier between the adjacent subcultures, if big enough, took the heat off.\n\nObviously, a rich mix of subcultures will not be possible if each subculture is being inhibited by pressure from its neighbors. The subcultures must therefore be separated by land, which is not residential land, and by as much of it as possible.\n\nThere is another kind of empirical observation which supports this last statement. If we look around a metropolitan area, and pinpoint the strongly differentiated subcultures, those with character, we shall always find that they are near boundaries and hardly ever close to other communities. For example, in San Francisco the two most distinctive areas are Telegraph Hill and Chinatown.\n\nTelegraph Hill is surrounded on two sides by the docks. Chinatown is bounded on two sides by the city's banking area. The same is true in the larger Bay Area. Point Richmond and Sausalito,\n\n![20_image_1.png](20_image_1.png)\n\nSubculturs boundaries.\n\n![20_image_0.png](20_image_0.png)\n\n![21_image_0.png](21_image_0.png)\n\ntwo of the most distinctive communities in the greater Bay Area, are both almost completely isolated. Sausalito is surrounded by hills and water; Point Richmond by water and industrial land. Communities which are cut off to some extent are free to develop their own character.\n\nFurther support for our argument comes from ecology. In nature, the differentiation of a species into subspecies is largely due to the process of geographic speciation, the genetic changes which take place during a period of spatial isolation (see, for example, Ernst Mayr, Animal Species and Evolution, Cambridge, 1963, Chapter 18: \"The Ecology of Speciation,\" pp. 556-85). It has been observed in a multitude of ecological studies that members of the same species develop distinguishable traits when separated from other members of the species by physical boundaries like a mountain ridge, a valley, a river, a dry strip of land, a cliff, or a significant change in climate or vegetation. In just the same way, differentiation between subcultures in a city will be able to take place most easily when the flow of those elements which account for cultural variety-values, style, information, and so on-is at least partially restricted between neighboring subcultures.\n\nTherefore: Separate neighboring subcultures with a swath of land at least 200 feet wide. Let this boundary be natural-wilderness, farmland, water-or man-made-railroads, major roads, parks, schools, some housing. Along the seam be-\n\ntween two subcultures, build mecting places, shared functions, touching each community.\n\n![22_image_0.png](22_image_0.png)\n\n* * *\nNatural boundaries can be things like THE COUNTRYSIDE (7),\nSACRED SITES (24), ACCESS TO WATER (25), QUIET BACKS (59), accessible creen (60), pools and streams (64), still water (71). Artificial boundaries can include RING ROADS (17), PARAL-\nILEL ROADS (23), WORK COMMUNITIES (41), INDUSTRIAL RIBBONS\n(42), TEENAGE SOCIETY (84), SHIELDED PARKING (97). The interior organization of the subculture boundary should follow two broad principles. It should concentrate the various land uses to form functional clusters around activity-ACTIVITY NODES\n(30), WORK COMMUNITY (41). And the boundary should be accessible to both the neighboring communities, so that it is a meeting ground for them-ECCENTRIC NUCLEUs (28) . . .\n","embeddings":[null]},{"document":"A PATTERN LANGUAGE\nVolume 1, The Timeless Way of Building, and Volume\n2, 4 Patrern Language, are two halves of a single work.\nThis book provides a language, for building and plan-\nning; the other book provides the theory and instruc-\ntions for the use of the language. This book. describes the\ndetailed patterns for towns and neighborhoods, houses,\ngardens, and rooms. The other book explains the disci-\npline which makes it possible to use these patterns to\ncreate a building or a town. This book is the sourcebook of\nthe timeless way; the other is its practice and its origin.\nThe two books have evolved very much in parallel.\nThey have been growing over the last eight years, as\nwe have worked on the one hand to understand the\nnature of the building process, and on the other hand to\nconstruct an actual, possible pattern language. We have\nbeen forced by practical considerations, to publish these\ntwo books under separate covers; but in fact, they form\nan indivisible whole. It is possible to read them sepa-\nrately. But to gain the insight which we have tried to\ncommunicate in them, it is essential that you read them\nboth.\nThe Timeless Way of Building describes the funda-\nmental nature of the task of making towns and buildings.\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nIt is shown there, that towns and buildings will not be\nable to become alive, unless they are made by all the\npeople in society, and unless these people share a com-\nmon pattern language, within which to make these\nbuildings, and unless this cornmon pattern language is\nalive itself.\nTn this book, we present one possible pattern language,\nof the kind called for in The Timeless Way. This lan-\nguage is extremely practical. It is a language that we\nhave distilled from our own building and planning ef-\nforts over the last eight years. You can use it to work\nwith your neighbors, to improve your town and neighbor-\nhood. You can use it to design a house for yourself,\nwith your family; or to work with other people to de-\nsign an office or a workshop or a public building like a\nschool. And you can use it to guide you in the actual\nprocess of construction.\nThe elements of this language are entities called pat-\nterns. Each pattern describes a problem which occurs\nover and over again in our environment, and then\ndescribes the core of the solution to that problem, in such\na way that you can use this solution a million times over,\nwithout ever doing it the same way twice.\nFor convenience and clarity, each pattern has the same\nformat. First, there is a picture, which shows an arche-\ntypal example of that pattern. Second, after the picture,\neach pattern has an introductory paragraph, which sets\nthe context for the pattern, by explaining how it helps\nto complete certain larger patterns. Then there are three\ndiamonds to mark the beginning of the problem. After\nthe diamonds there is a headline, in bold type. This\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nheadline gives the essence of the problem in one or two\nsentences. After the headline comes the body of the\nproblem. This is the longest section. It describes the\nempirical background of the pattern, the evidence for its\nvalidity, the range of different ways the pattern can be\nmanifested in a building, and so on. Then, again in\nbold type, like the headline, is the solution—the heart\nof the pattern—which describes the field of physical and\nsocial relationships which are required to solve the stated\nproblem, in the stated context. This solution is always\nexactly what you need to do, to build the pattern. Then,\nafter the solution, there is a diagram, which shows the\nsolution in the form of a diagram, with labels to indicate\nits main components.\nAfter the diagram, another three diamonds, to show\nthat the main body of the pattern is finished. And finally,\nafter the diamonds there is a paragraph which ties the\npattern to all those smaller patterns in the language,\nwhich are needed to complete this pattern, to embellish\nit, to All it out.\nThere are two essential purposes behind this format.\nFirst, to present each pattern connected to other patterns,\nso that you grasp the collection of all 253 patterns as a\nwhole, as a language, within which you can create an in-\nfinite variety of combinations. Second, to present the\nproblem and solution of each pattern in such a way that\nyou can judge it for yourself, and modify it, without\nlosing the essence that is central to it.\nLet us next understand the nature of the connection\nbetween patterns.\nXI\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nThe patterns are ordered, beginning with the very\nlargest, for regions and towns, then working down\nthrough neighborhoods, clusters of buildings, buildings,\nrooms and alcoves, ending finally with details of con-\nstruction.\nThis order, which is presented as a straight linear\nsequerice, is essential to the way the language works. It is\npresented, and explained more fully, in the next section.\nWhat is most important about this sequence, is that it is\nbased on the connections between the patterns. Each\npattern is connected to certain “larger” patterns which\ncome above it in the language; and to certain “smaller”\npatterns which come below it in the language. The pat-\ntern helps to complete those larger patterns which are\n“above” it, and is itself completed by those smaller pat-\nterns which are “below” it.\nThus, for example, you will find that the pattern ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN (60), is connected first to certain larger\npatterns: SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY (13), IDENTIFIABLE\nNEIGHBORHOOD (14), WORK COMMUNITY (41), and\nquirr Backs (59). These appear on its first page. And it\nis also connected to certain smaller patterns: PosiTIVE\nOUTDOOR SPACE (107), TREE PLACES (171), and GARDEN\nWALL (173). These appear on its last page.\nWhat this means, is that IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBOR-\nHOOD, SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, WORK COMMUNITY, and\nQUIET BACKS are incomplete, unless they contain an ac-\nCESSIBLE GREEN; and that an ACCESSIBLE GREEN is itself\nincomplete, unless it contains POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nAnd what it means in practical terms is that, if you\nx\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to lay out a green according to this pattern, you\nmust not only follow the instructions which describe the\npattern itself, but must also try to embed the green\nWithin an IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD or in some sUB-\nCULTURE BOUNDARY, and in a way that helps to form\nquizr Backs; and then you must work to complete the\ngreen by building in some posiTIVE OUTDOOR SPACE,\nTREE PLACES, and a GARDEN WALL.\nIn short, no pattern is an isolated entity. Each pattern\ncan exist in the world, only to the extent that is sup-\nported by other patterns: the larger patterns in which it\nis embedded, the patterns of the same size that surround\nit, and the smaller patterns which are embedded in it.\nThis is a fundamental view of the world, It says that\nwhen you build a thing you cannot merely build that\nthing in isolation, but must also repair the world around\nit, and within it, so that the larger world at that one\nplace becomes more coherent, and more whole; and the\nthing which you make takes its place in the web of na-\nture, as you make it.\nNow we explain the nature of the relation between\nproblems and solutions, within the individual patterns.\nEach solution is stated in such a way that it gives the\nessential field of relationships needed to solve the prob-\nlem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you\ncan solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by\nadapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions\nat the place where you are making it.\nFor this reason, we have tried to write each solution\nin a way which imposes nothing on you. It contains only\nthose essentials which cannot be avoided if you really\nXU\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwant to solve the problem. In this sense, we have tried,\nin each solution, to capture the invariant property com-\nmon to all places which succeed in solving the problem.\nBut of course, we have not always succeeded. The\nsolutions we have given to these problems vary in signif-\ncance, Some are more true, more profound, more cer-\ntain, than others. To show this clearly we have marked\nevery pattern, in the text itself, with two asterisks, or one\nasterisk, or no asterisks.\nIn the patterns marked with two asterisks, we believe\nthat we have succeeded in stating a true invariant: in\nshort, that the solution we have stated summarizes a\nproperty common to all possible ways of solving the\nstated problem. In these two-asterisk cases we believe,\nin short, that it is not possible to solve the stated prob-\nlem properly, without shaping the environment in one\nway or another according to the pattern that we have\ngiven—and that, in these cases, the pattern describes\na deep and inescapable property of a well-formed en-\nvironment.\nIn the patterns marked with one asterisk, we believe\nthat we have made some progress towards identifying\nsuch an invariant: but that with careful work it will\ncertainly be possible to improve on the solution, In\nthese cases, we believe it would be wise for you to treat\nthe pattern with a certain amount of disrespect—and\nthat you seek out variants of the solution which we have\ngiven, since there are almost certainly possible ranges of\nsolutions which are not covered by what we have written.\nFinally, in the patterns without an asterisk, we are\ncertain that we have mot succeeded in defining a true\nx1V\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\ninvariant—that, on the contrary, there are certainly ways\nof solving the problem different from the one which we\nhave given. In these cases we have still stated a solution,\nin order to be concrete—to provide the reader with at\nleast one way of solving the problem-—but the task of\nfinding the true invariant, the true property which hes\nat the heart of all possible solutions to this problem, re-\nmains undone.\nWe hope, of course, that many of the people who\nread, and use this language, will try to improve these\npatterns—will put their energy to work, in this task of\nfinding more true, more profound invariants—and we\nhope that gradually these more true patterns, which are\nslowly discovered, as time goes on, will enter a common\nlanguage, which all of us can share.\nYou see then that the patterns are very much alive\nand evolving. In fact, if you like, each pattern may be\nlooked upon as a hypothesis like one of the hypotheses of\nscience. In this sense, each pattern represents our current\nbest guess as to what arrangement of the physical envi-\nronment will work to solve the problem presented. The\nempirical questions center on the problem—does it occur\nand is it felt in the way we have described it?—-and the\nsolution—-does the arrangement we propose in fact re-\nsolve the problem? And the asterisks represent our\ndegree of faith in these hypotheses. But of course, no\nmatter what the asterisks say, the patterns are still\nhypotheses, all 253 of them-—-and are therefore all\ntentative, all free to evolve under the impact of new\nexperience and observation.\nLet us finally explain the status of this language, why\nA PATTERN LANGUAGE\nwe have called it “A Pattern Language” with the em-\nphasis on the word “A,” and how we imagine this pat-\ntern language might be related to the countless thou-\nsands of other languages we hope that people will make\nfor themselves, in the future.\nThe Timeless Way of Building says that every society\nwhich is alive and whole, will have its own unique and\ndistinct pattern language; and further, that every in-\ndividual in such a society will have a unique language,\nshared in part, but which as a totality is unique to the\nraind of the person who has it. In this sense, in a healthy\nsociety there will be as many pattern languages as there\nare people—even though these languages are shared and\nsimular,\nThe question then arises: What exactly is the status\nof this published language? In what frame of mind, and\nwith what intention, are we publishing this language\nhere? The fact that it is published as a book means that\nmany thousands of people can use it. Is it not true that\nthere is a danger that people might come to rely on this\none printed language, instead of developing their own\nlanguages, in their own minds?\nThe fact is, that we have written this book as a first\nstep in the society-wide process by which people will\ngradually become conscious of their own pattern lan-\nguages, and work to improve them. We believe, and\nhave explained in The Timeless Way of Building, that\nthe languages which people have today are so brutal, and\nso fragmented, that most people no longer have any\nlanguage to speak of at all—and what they do have is\nnot based on human, or natural considerations.\nXVI\n& PATTERN LANGUAGE\nWe have spent years trying to formulate this lan-\nguage, in the hope that when a person uses tt, he will\nbe so impressed by its power, and so joyful in its use,\nthat he will understand again, what it means to have a\nliving language of this kind. [If we only succeed in that,\nit is possible that each person may once again embark on\nthe construction and development of his own language—\nperhaps taking the language printed in this book, as a\npoint of departure.\nAnd yet, we do believe, of course, that this language\nwhich is printed here is something more than a manual,\nor a teacher, or a version of a possible pattern language.\nMany of the patterns here are archetypal—so deep, so\ndeeply rooted in the nature of things, that it seems likely\nthat they will be a part of human nature, and human ac-\ntion, as much in five hundred years, as they are today.\nWe doubt very much whether anyone could construct\na valid pattern language, in his own mind, which did\nnot include the pattern arcapes (119) for example, or\nthe pattern aLcoves (179).\nIn this sense, we have also tried to penetrate, as deep\nas we are able, into the nature of things in the environ-\nment: and hope that a great part of this language, which\nwe print here, will be a core of any sensible human pat-\ntern language, which any person constructs for himself,\nin his own mind. In this sense, at least a part of the\nlanguage we have presented here, is the archetypal core\nof all possible pattern languages, which can make people\nfeel alive and human.\nXVII\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nA pattern language has the structure of a network. This\nis explained fully in The Timeless Way of Bualdimg.\nHowever, when we use the network of a language, we\nalways use it as a sequence, going through the patterns,\nmoving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,\nalways from the ones which create structures, to the ones\nwhich then embellish those structures, and then to those\nwhich embellish the embellishments. . . .\nSince the language is in truth a network, there is no\none sequence which perfectly captures it. But the se-\nquence which follows, captures the broad sweep of the\nfull network; in doing so, it follows a line, dips down,\ndips up again, and follows an irregular course, a little\nlike a needle following a tapestry.\nThe sequence of patterns is both a summary of the\nlanguage, and at the same time, an index to the patterns.\nIf you read through the sentences which connect the\ngroups of patterns to one another, you will get an over-\nview of the whole language. And once you get this over-\nview, you will then be able to find the patterns which\nare relevant to your own project.\nAnd finally, as we shall explain in the next section,\nthis sequence of patterns is also the “base map,” from\nKVL\nSUMMARY OF THE LANGUAGE\nwhich you can make a language for your own project,\nby choosing the patterns which are most useful to you,\nand leaving them more or less in the order that you\nfind them printed here.\nWe begin with that part of the language which defines\na town or community. These patterns can never be “de-\nsigned” or “buil?” in one fell swoop—but patient piece-\nmeal growth, designed in such a way that every indi-\nvidual act is always helping to create or generate these\nlarger global patterns, will, slowly and surely, over the\nyears, make a community that has these global patterns\nin tk.\nI.

They create\na coherent picture of an entire region, with the power\nto generate such regions in a million forms, with in-\nfinite variety in all the details.\nIt 1s also true that any small sequence of patterns from\nthis language is itself a language for a smaller part of\nthe environment; and this small list of patterns is then\ncapable of generating a million parks, paths, houses,\nworkshops, or gardens.\nFor example, consider the following ten patterns:\nPRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET (140)\nSUNNY PLACE (161)\nOUTDOOR ROOM (163)\nSIX-FOOT BALCONY (167)\nPATHS AND GOALS (120)\nCEILING HEIGHT VARIETY (190)\nCOLUMNS AT THE CORNERS (212)\nFRONT DOOR BENCH (242)\nRAISED FLOWERS (245)\nDIFFERENT CHAIRS (251)\nThis short list of patterns is itself a language: it is one\nof a thousand possible languages for a porch, at the front\nof a house, One of us chose this small language, to build\nAXERV\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBYJECT\na porch onto the front of his house. This is the way the\nlanguage, and its patterns, helped to generate this porch.\nI started with PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE sTREET (140). That\npattern calls for a terrace, slightly raised, connected to the house,\nand on the street side. suNNY PLACE (161) suggests that a special\nplace on the sunny side of the yard should be intensified and\nmade into a place by the use of a patio, balcony, outdoor room,\netc, | used these two patterns to locate a raised platform on the\nsouth side of the house.\nit half under the existing roof overhang, and kept a mature\npyracanthus tree right smack in the middle of the platform. The\noverhead foliage of the tree added to the roof-like enclosure of\nthe space. I put a wind screen of fixed glass on the west side of\nthe platform too, to give it even more enclosure.\nplatform. But this pattern had to be used judiciously and not\nblindly—the reasoning for the pattern has to do with the mini-\nmum space required for people to sit comfortably and carry on a\ndiscussion around a small side-table. Since 1 wanted space for at\nleast two of these conversation areas—one under the roof for very\nfeet square.\nNow PATHS AND Goats (120): Usually, this pattern deals with\nlarge paths in a neighborhood, and comes much earlier in a lan-\nguage. But I used it in a special way. It says that the paths which\nnaturally get formed by people’s walking, on the land, should be\npreserved and intensified. Since the path to our front door cut\nright across the corner of the place where 1 had planned to put\nthe platform, 1 cut the corner of the platform aff.\nThe height of the platform above the ground was determined\nby CEILING HEIGHT varieETY (190). By building the platform\napproximately one foot above the ground line, the ceiling height\nof the covered portion came out at between 6 and 7 feet——just\nright for a space as small as this. Since this height above the\nBOOR BENCH (242) was automatically satisfied.\nThere were three columns standing, supporting the roof over\nXXXVI]ground level is just about right for sitting, the pattern FRONT\nhot or rainy days, and one out under the sky for days when you\nwanted to be full in the sun, the balcony had to be made 12 x 12\nI used six-Foor BaLcony (167) to determine the size of the\nTo make this platform into an ovTsoor Room (163), I put\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nthe old porch, They had to stay where they are, because they hold\nthe roof up. But, following covumns ar THE coRNERs (212),\nthe platform was very carefully tailored to their positions—so that\nthe columns help define the social spaces on either side of them.\nFinally, we put a couple of flower boxes next to the “front door\nbench”—it’s nice to smell them when you sit there—according to\nRAISED FLowERs (245). And the old chairs you can see in the\nporch are DIeFERENT CHAIRS (251).\nYou can see, from this short example, how powerful\nand simple a pattern language is, And you are now,\nperhaps ready to appreciate how careful you must be,\nwhen you construct a language for yourself and your\nown project.\nThe character of the porch is given by the ten patterns\nin this short language. In just this way, each part of the\nenvironment is given its character by the collection of\npatterns which we choose to build into it. The character\nof what you build, will be given to it by the language of\npatterns you use, to generate it.\nXxxvii\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nFor this reason, of course, the task of choosing a lan-\nguage for your project is fundamental. The pattern lan-\nguage we have given here contains 253 patterns. You\ncan therefore use it to generate an almost unimaginably\nlarge number of possible different smaller languages,\nfor all the different projects you may choose to do,\nsimply by picking patterns from it.\nWe shall now describe a rough procedure by which\nyou can choose a language for your own project, first by\ntaking patterns from this language we have printed here,\nand then by adding patterns of your own.\nr. First of all, make a copy of the master sequence\n(pages xix-xxxiv) on which you can tick off the patterns\nwhich will form the language for your project. If you\ndon’t have access to a copying machine, you can tick off\npatterns in the list printed in the book, use paper clips\nto mark pages, write your own list, use paper markers—\nwhatever you like. But just for now, to explain it clearly,\nwe shall assume that you have a copy of the list in front\nof you.\n2. Scan down the list, and find the pattern which\nbest describes the overall scope of the project you have\nin mind, This is the starting pattern for your project.\nTick it. CIE there are two or three possible candidates,\ndon’t worry: just pick the one which seems best: the\nothers will fall in place as you move forward.)\n3. Turn to the starting pattern itself, in the book, and\nread it through. Notice that the other patterns men-\ntioned by name at the beginning and at the end, of the\npattern you are reading, are also possible candidates for\nyour language. The ones at the beginning will tend to be\n“larger” than your project. Don’t include them, unless\nXXXVI\nCHOOSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nyou have the power to help create these patterns, at least\nin a small way, in the world around your project. The\nones at the end are “smaller.” Almost all of them will\nbe important. Tick all of them, on your list, unless you\nhave some special reason for not wanting to include\nthem.\n4. Now your list has some more ticks on it. Turn to\nthe next highest pattern on the list which is ticked, and\nopen the book to that pattern. Once again, it will lead\nyou to other patterns. Once again, tick those which are\nrelevant—especially the ones which are “smaller” that\ncome at the end. As a general rule, do not tick the ones\nwhich are “larger” unless you can do something about\nthem, concretely, in your own project.\n5. When in doubt about a pattern, don’t include it.\nYour list can easily get too long: and if it does, it will\nbecome confusing. The list will be quite long enough,\neven if you only include the patterns you especially like.\n6. Keep going like this, until you have ticked all the\npatterns you want for your project.\n7. Now, adjust the sequence by adding your own ma-\nterial. If there are things you want to include in your\nproject, but you have not been able to find patterns which\ncorrespond to them, then write them in, at an appropri-\nate point in the sequence, near other patterns which are\nof about the same size and importance. For example,\nthere is no pattern for a sauna. If you want to include\none, write it in somewhere near BATHING ROOM (144)\nin your sequence.\n8. And of course, if you want to change any patterns,\nchange them. There are often cases where you may have\na personal version of a pattern, which is more true, or\nXXXIN\nCHOCSING A LANGUAGE FOR YOUR SUBJECT\nmore relevant for you. In this case, you will get the most\n“power” over the language, and make it your own most\neffectively, if you write the changes in, at the appropri-\nate places in the book. And, it will be most concrete of\nall, if you change the name of the pattern too—so that\nit captures your own changes clearly.\nyp oe\nSuppose now that you have a language for your proj-\nect. The way to use the language depends very much\non its scale. Patterns dealing with towns can only be\nimplemented gradually, by grass roots action; patterns\nfor a building can be built up in your mind, and marked\nout on the ground; patterns for construction must be\nbuilt physically, on the site. For this reason we have\ngiven three separate instructions, for these three different\nscales. For towns, see page 3; for buildings, see page\n463; for construction, see page 935.\nThe procedures for each of these three scales are de-\nscribed in much more detail with extensive examples,\nin the appropriate chapters of The Timeless Way of\nBuilding. For the town—see chapters 24 and 25; for an\nindividual building—see chapters 20, 21, and 22; and for\nthe process of construction which describes the way a\nbuilding is actually built see chapter 23.\nxh\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nFinally, a note of caution. This language, lke English,\ncan be a medium for prose, or a medium for poetry. The\ndifference between prose and poetry is not that different\nJanpuages are used, but that the same language is used,\ndifferently. In an ordinary English sentence, each word\nhas one meaning, and the sentence too, has one simple\nmeaning. In a poem, the meaning is far more dense.\nEach word carries several meanings; and the sentence\nas a Whole carries an enormous density of interlocking\nmeanings, which together illuminate the whole.\nThe same is true for pattern languages. It is possible\nto make buildings by stringing together patterns, in a\nrather loose way. A building made like this, is an as-\nsembly of patterns. It is not dense. It is not profound.\nBut it 1s also possible to put patterns together in such a\nway that many many patterns overlap in the same\nphysical space: the building is very dense; it has many\nmeanings captured in a small space; and through this\ndensity, it becomes profound.\nIn a poern, this kind of density, creates illumination,\nby making identities between words, and meanings,\nwhose identity we have not understood before. In “O\nRose thou art sick,” the rose is identifed with many\nxii\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\ngreater, and more personal things than any rose—and\nthe poem illuminates the person, and the rose, because of\nthis connection. The connection not only illuminates the\nwords, but also illuminates our actual lives.\n© Rose thon art sick,\n‘The invisible worm,\nThat flies in the night\nin the howling storm:\nHas found out thy bed\nOF crimson joy:\nAnd his dark secret Jove\nDoes thy life destroy,\nWILLIAM BLAKE\nThe same exactly, happens in a building, Consider, for\nexample, the two patterns BATHING ROOM (144) and\nSTILL WATER (71). One defines a part of a house where\nyou can bathe yourself slowly, with pleasure, perhaps\nin company; a place to rest your limbs, and to relax. The\nother is a place in a neighborhood, where this is water\nto gaze into, perhaps to swim in, where children can sail\nboats, and splash about, which nourishes those parts of\nourselves which rely on water as one of the great\nelements of the unconscious.\nSuppose now, that we make a complex of buildings\nwhere individual bathing rooms are somehow connected\nto a common pond, or lake, or pool—where the bathing\nroom merges with this common place; where there is no\nsharp distinction between the individual and family pro-\ncesses of the bathing room, and the common pleasure\nof the common pool. In this place, these two patterns\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nexist in the same space; they are identified, there is a\ncompression of the two, which requires less space, and\nwhich is more profound than in a place where they are\nmerely side by side. The compression illuminates each\nof the patterns, sheds light on its meaning; and also i-\nluminates our lives, as we understand a little more about\nthe connections of our inner needs.\nBut this kind of compression is not only poetic and\nprofound. It is not only the stuff of poems and exotic\nstatements, but to some degree, the stuff of every English\nsentence. To some depree, there is compression in every\nsingle word we utter, just because each word carries the\nwhisper of the meanings of the words it is connected to.\nEven “Please pass the butter, Fred” has some compres-\nsion in it, because it carries overtones that lie in the con-\nnections of these words to all the words which came be-\nfore it.\nFach of us, talking to our friends, or to our families,\nmakes use of these compressions, which are drawn out\nfrom the connections between words which are given by\nthe language. The more we can feel all the connections\nin the language, the more rich and subtle are the things\nwe say at the most ordinary times.\nAnd once again, the same is true in building. The com-\npression of patterns into a single space, is not a poetic\nand exotic thing, kept for special buildings which are\nworks of art. It is the most ordinary economy of space. It\nis quite possible that all the patterns for a house might,\nin some form be present, and overlapping, in a simple\none-room cabin, The patterns do not need to be strung\nout, and kept separate. Every building, every room,\nxd\nTHE POETRY OF THE LANGUAGE\nevery garden is better, when all the patterns which it\nneeds are compressed as far as it is possible for them to\nbe. The building will be cheaper; and the meanings in it\nwill be denser.\nIt is essential then, once you have learned to use the\nlanguage, that you pay attention to the possibility of\ncompressing the many patterns which you put together,\nin the smallest possible space. You may think of this\nprocess of compressing patterns, as a way to make the\ncheapest possible building which has the necessary pat-\nterns in it. It is, also, the only way of using a pattern\nlanguage to make buildings which are poems.\n","summary":"This chunk on \"Sacred Sites\" is part of a larger pattern language for designing towns, neighborhoods, buildings, and spaces. It discusses the importance of preserving and enhancing special places that have symbolic meaning for a community, and provides guidelines for how to approach and reveal these sacred sites.","chunk":"# 24 Sacred Sites*\n\n![74_Image_0.Png](74_Image_0.Png)\n\n. . . in every region and every town, indeed in every neighborhood, there are special places which have come to symbolize the area, and the people's roots there. These places may be natural beauties or historic landmarks left by ages past. But in some form they are essential.\n\nPeople cannot maintain their spiritual roots and their connections to the past if the physical world they live in does not also sustain these roots.\n\nInformal experiments in our communities have led us to believe that people agree, to an astonishing extent, about the sites which do embody people's relation to the land and to the past.\n\nIt seems, in other words, as though \"the\" sacred sites for an area exist as objective communal realities.\n\nIf this is so, it is then of course essential that these specific sites be preserved and made important. Destruction of sites which have become part of the communal consciousness, in an agreed and widespread sense, must inevitably create gaping wounds in the communal body.\n\nTraditional societies have always recognized the importance of these sites, Mountains are marked as places of special pilgrimage; rivers and bridges become holy; a building or a tree, or rock or stone, takes on the power through which people can connect themselves to their own past.\n\nBut modern society often ignores the psychological importance of these sites. They are bulldozed, developed, changed, for political and economic reasons, without regard for these simple but fundamental emotional matters; or they are simply ignored.\n\nWe suggest the following two steps.\n\nI. In any geographic area-large or small-ask a large number of people which sites and which places make them feel the most contact with the area; which sites stand most for the important values of the past, and which ones embody their connection to the land. Then insist that these sites be actively preserved.\n\n2. Once the sites are chosen and preserved, embellish them in\n\na way which intensifies their public meaning. We believe that the best way to intensify a site is through a progression of areas which people pass through as they approach the site. This is the principle of \"nested precincts,\" discussed in detail under the pattern HOLY GROUND (66).\n\nA garden which can be reached only by passing through a series of outer gardens keeps its secrecy. A temple which can be reached only by passing through a sequence of approach courts is able to be a special thing in a man's heart. The magnificence of a mountain peak is increased by the difficulty of reaching the upper valleys from which it can be seen; the beauty of a woman is intensified by the slowness of her unveiling; the great beauty of a river bank-its rushes, water rats, small fish, wild flowers-are violated by a too direct approach ; even the ecology cannot stand up to the too direct approach-the thing will simply be devoured.\n\nWe must therefore build around a sacred site a series of spaces which gradually intensify and converge on the site. The site itself becomes a kind of inner sanctum, at the core. And if the site is very large-a mountain-the same approach can be taken with special places from which it can be seen-an inner sanctum, reached past many levels, which is not the mountain, but a garden, say, from which the mountain can be seen in special beauty.\n\nTherefore:\nWhether the sacred sites are large or small, whether they are at the center of the towns, in neighborhoods, or in the deepest countryside, establish ordinances which will protect them absolutely-so that our roots in the visible surroundings cannot be violated.\n\n![76_image_0.png](76_image_0.png)\n\nacts of preservation\n\n## 133 中 中 中\n\nGive every sacred site a place, or a sequence of places, where people can relax, enjoy themselves, and feel the presence of the place-quiet Backs (59), zen view (134), tree places (171),\nCARDEN SEAT (176). And above all, shield the approach to the site, so that it can only be approached on foot, and through a series of gateways and thresholds which reveal it gradually-HOLY GROUND (66). . . .","embeddings":[null]}]
